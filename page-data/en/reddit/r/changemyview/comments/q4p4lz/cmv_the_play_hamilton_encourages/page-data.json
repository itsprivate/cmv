That&#39;s why I decided I wanted to teach it. I want to encourage passionate and nuanced understanding of history in the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>I have an...intense love-hate relationship with the play &quot;Hamilton&quot; for this reason. On one hand, I&#39;m happy that it has inspired so much interest in the American Revolution among younger people. I personally love a number of songs from it as well. They&#39;re catchy, and they communicate the point well. Hell, I even think the race-bending idea is interesting. I have my problems with how it is done, but I like that young minorities can see themselves in the founders. See past race and see them for who they were otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>On the other...I detest the way the play portrays Alexander Hamilton in particular. Make no mistake, Alexander Hamilton was the most right-wing of the Founding Fathers. He argued for an elected monarchy, he said the common people needed an &quot;elite&quot; to guide them, he pushed the country towards war with France, he propped up Wall Street at the expense of small landowners, and he was so personally detestable that he made an enemy of John Adams, his closest ideological ally.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, he was lightly anti-slavery, but so were <strong>all</strong> the Founding Fathers to one degree or another. Hamilton joined the New York manumission society, sure. But, while his rival Thomas Jefferson banned the import of slaves as President - and before that tried to ban slavery in the west, and fought for legalizing the manumission of slaves - Hamilton has next to nothing to claim credit for on this front.</p>\n\n<p>And yeah, let&#39;s keep this comparison with Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson worked to expand democracy for the common man, supported the populist French Revolution, argued Native Americans were equal to whites, and took pot-shots at slavery wherever he could. Was he a hypocrite? Sure, to an extent. His concerns regarding freeing slaves and the impracticability of freeing his own slaves aside, he ultimately failed to end slavery even in his own life. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Jefferson stands head-and-shoulders above the other Founding Fathers (aside from Ben Franklin, in all fairness) for his advocacy for the rights of everyday citizens. While Hamilton&#39;s philosophy was that &quot;If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monarchy&quot;, Jefferson&#39;s was &quot;I subscribe to the principle, that the will of the majority honestly expressed should give law.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, how is this all portrayed in &quot;Hamilton&quot;, the play so beloved by so many young people? Hamilton was a self-made man and ardent abolitionist who stood up for the rights of the people against the elitist slave-owner Jefferson. The only reason I can fathom why he was rehabilitated is that Hamilton didn&#39;t own slaves, while Jefferson did. So they sweep the overwhelmingly problematic parts of his legacy aside and exaggerate the positives to a comical degree.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the real shame of it all. A race-bent portrayal of the Revolution could have encouraged an understanding of the Founders that wasn&#39;t so caught up in race. Yet, the underlying framework for the play still seems stooped in that issue. And the sad result is that many, many young people are being mislead to believe that Hamilton, the most authoritarian of all the Founders, was some progressive hero.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, and please, Change My View.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q4p4lz/cmv_the_play_hamilton_encourages/","title":"CMV: The play \"Hamilton\" encourages misinterpretation of Hamilton and Jefferson","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-09T19:33:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-09 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q4p4lz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q4p4lz/cmv_the_play_hamilton_encourages/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q4p4lz/cmv_the_play_hamilton_encourages/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Kasunex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kasunex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Kasunex","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 「ハミルトン」は、ハミルトンとジェファーソンの誤解を招く作品","the_new_excerpt":"歴史好きで、BAの歴史家で、最近では歴史の教師でもある私は、長い間\n一般の人々が多くの歴史上の出来事をどのように見ているかに不満を持っていました。\n歴史を教えたいと思ったのはそのためです。だからこそ、歴史を教えたいと思ったのです。私は\n情熱的でニュアンスに富んだ歴史の理解を促したい...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：戏剧《汉密尔顿》鼓励对汉密尔顿和杰斐逊的误解","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个历史爱好者，一个本科历史学家，以及最近的历史教师，我长期以来\n我对普通大众如何看待一些历史事件有不满。\n以及整个历史。这就是为什么我决定要教它。我想\n鼓励对历史的热情和细微的理解......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：戲劇《漢密爾頓》鼓勵對漢密爾頓和傑斐遜的誤解","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個歷史愛好者，一個本科歷史學家，以及最近的歷史教師，我長期以來\n我對普通大衆如何看待一些歷史事件有不滿。\n以及整個歷史。這就是爲什麼我決定要教它。我想\n鼓勵對歷史的熱情和細微的理解......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q4e829","excerpt":"(If this has already been discussed please link it😁)\n\nSo I've been on tiktok a lot and there will be a video with a black person\ntalking \"proper\", basically not AAVE, and there will be hundreds of comments\ncalling them whitewashed and asking if they've been \"picked\" by the whites yet.\nThey also…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q4e829/cmv_calling_a_black_person_whitewashed_is_racist/","title":"Cmv: calling a black person whitewashed is racist.","date":"October 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Cmv：黒人をホワイトウォッシュと呼ぶのは差別です。","the_new_excerpt":"(既に話題になっていたらリンクしてください😁)\n\ntiktokをよく見ていると、黒人の人が「ちゃんと」話しているビデオがありますよね。\n基本的にはAAVEではなく、「ちゃんと」話している黒人のビデオがあると、何百ものコメントが寄せられます。\n白人に選ばれたのか？\n彼らはまた...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Cmv：说黑人洗白是种族主义者。","the_new_excerpt":"(如果这个问题已经被讨论过了，请链接它😁)\n\n我经常上tiktok，会有一个视频，里面有一个黑人\n适当的 \"谈话\"，基本上不是AAVE，就会有数百条评论\n说他们被洗白了，问他们是否已经被白人 \"选中\"。\n他们还...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cmv：說黑人洗白是種族主義者。","the_new_excerpt":"(如果這個問題已經被討論過了，請鏈接它😁)\n\n我經常上tiktok，會有一個視頻，裏面有一個黑人\n適當的 \"談話\"，基本上不是AAVE，就會有數百條評論\n說他們被洗白了，問他們是否已經被白人 \"選中\"。\n他們還...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q4r1f1","excerpt":"There are exceptions to this and that is if they are in a position of power and\nauthority and their speech indicated they are negatively impacting groups of\npeople in their lives due to being the owner of a business, a politician, or a\nperson of legal authority.\n\nWith in that exception it needs to…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q4r1f1/cmv_society_needs_to_get_back_to_ignoring_speech/","title":"CMV: Society needs to get back to ignoring speech someone doesn't like instead of trying to get them fired or cancelled.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 09, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 社会は、誰かが気に入らない発言をした場合、その人を解雇したり中止させたりするのではなく、無視することに戻るべきです。","the_new_excerpt":"例外はありますが、それはその人が権力や権威のある立場にいて、その人の発言がネガティブなものであった場合です。\n権力者の立場にあり、その発言が生活の中で人々に悪影響を与えていることを示している場合です。\n企業の経営者、政治家、法律上の権限を持つ人など、生活の中で人々に悪影響を与えていることを示す場合です。\n権力者の場合です。\n\nただし、その場合は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：社会需要回到无视有人不喜欢的言论，而不是试图让他们被解雇或取消。","the_new_excerpt":"但也有例外，那就是如果他们处于权力和权威的地位\n而他们的言论表明他们在生活中对一些群体产生了负面影响。\n他们是企业主、政治家或有法律权力的人，在他们的生活中产生了负面影响。\n具有法律权威的人。\n\n在这种例外情况下，它需要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：社會需要回到無視有人不喜歡的言論，而不是試圖讓他們被解僱或取消。","the_new_excerpt":"但也有例外，那就是如果他們處於權力和權威的地位\n而他們的言論表明他們在生活中對一些羣體產生了負面影響。\n他們是企業主、政治家或有法律權力的人，在他們的生活中產生了負面影響。\n具有法律權威的人。\n\n在這種例外情況下，它需要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q4p4lz","previousId":"RedditPost-q4e829","nextId":"RedditPost-q4r1f1","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q4p4lz/cmv_the_play_hamilton_encourages/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},
