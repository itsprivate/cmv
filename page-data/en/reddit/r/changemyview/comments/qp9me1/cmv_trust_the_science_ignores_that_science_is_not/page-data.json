And in the end, it is more likely that people who have spent years studying a certain subject are going to, for the most part, have more accurate knowledge (at least the knowledge available at the time) than a layperson. </p>\n\n<p>What I am criticizing, though, is extending this mindset to having total and complete blind faith in science (or really any kind of expertise, though I’m kind of trying to limit it to science for now because I’ve seen it the most recently), and ridiculing/lambasting people who are not in the field for questioning it. Aside from the fact that conclusions previously made can change with new evidence, there are also many cases in which scientific studies can be prone to bias, monetary influence (one example that comes to mind is studies connected to the tobacco industry that were actively misleading in the conclusions they came to about the effects of smoking, secondhand smoke, etc), just plain missing a potentially important factor, etc. I believe there is also a tendency for scientific studies to largely be focused on testing new hypotheses and not on looking to see if old ones can be disproved, but I don’t remember much on that so I’m not too sure about that one.</p>\n\n<p>On a semi-related note, there have also been examples of medical procedures touted as being safe, or that have been approved by government agencies, but it turns out there were loopholes in the approval process that were taken advantage of, and it turns out later they were actually causing a host of medical issues for many people, after years of connecting the dots, sometimes with the issue not even being acknowledged until multiple people connected online and they all had the shared experience of having medical issues after that procedure. (I’m sorry this is so vague, the main one I think of is a chrome-based leg or hip implant I believe that was causing people neurological issues, the source for this and a few others was The Bleeding Edge documentary on Netflix - perhaps someone in the comments will tell me that was all hooey though and that I’m a bumbling idiot for believing a word of it LOL)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don’t think it’s reasonable to extrapolate instances in which experts and “trusted institutions” betrayed trust or messed up to mean they will mess up in ALL situations, or that a specific situation must be iffy and unworth trusting - for example, with the COVID vaccines. People worry about the newness of it, and in some of the procedures/medical devices in the documentary, the newness of it did mean that people who got in on it on the initial release of it were at more of a disadvantage since there wasn’t as much information showing the dangers of it - but medical devices and vaccines could also be relevantly different where the “newness” of it is not really that impactful on how much it can be trusted. Ideally, the trustworthiness of something should be decided on the details of that specific thing and it’s specific traits - but again, that becomes a problem when people aren’t knowledgeable and when the institutions that provide information have themselves become harder to trust. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, too, trusting any authority with a large amount of influence over your life completely is just a dangerous game to play. It may turn out well often, but for some, they could put themselves in the hands of someone corrupt, inept, or just become subject to a field that is still imperfect or always in development, and a set of people who believe that because they have specialized knowledge/training that nobody outside their field could ever have a relevant question, when really they are just as human and imperfect in their knowledge as the rest of us and could be blinded by their own perception of expertise. Not saying all people in scientific fields are like this, or saying anything about its frequency, I’m just saying it could HAPPEN.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I get using expertise as a crutch, but not as dogmatic truth, because expertise is usually not perfect. It’s also possible that some of this is an issue of semantics/people not arguing their position very well or not wanting to put in the effort of explaining a specific scientific position all the time - I might understand that more as just a blip, and not hold anything against that as much, I don’t know. I’m just taking issue against the instances I have seen where the people saying that do genuinely believe that questioning science/expertise to any degree is something only an idiot or contrarian would do. </p>\n\n<p>(As another note, I know some of this got more general than the original title, and there may be some things that were vague, if needed I can clarify some things to express my views better or more specifically. Apologies for not being the most organized communicator, I</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qp9me1/cmv_trust_the_science_ignores_that_science_is_not/","title":"CMV: “Trust the science” ignores that science is not always a perfectly followed process in the real world and may even be dangerous","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"November 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-08T14:37:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-08 14:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qp9me1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qp9me1/cmv_trust_the_science_ignores_that_science_is_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qp9me1/cmv_trust_the_science_ignores_that_science_is_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"a-naris","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/a-naris","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"a-naris","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: \"Trust the science \"は、科学が現実の世界では必ずしも完璧に守られたプロセスではなく、危険な場合もあることを無視しています。","the_new_excerpt":"(これはCOVIDと半々の関係で、この議論はよく出てきますが、気候変動に疑問を持つ人への回答でも出てきました。\n気候変動に疑問を持つ人への回答でも出てきました。\n進化論などに疑問を持つ人への回答でも見られます）。\n\n専門家を信頼することは、確率の指標として理解しています。\n専門家を信頼することは、確率の指標として、また、ほとんどの人が...という必然的な事実に対する松葉杖として理解しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：\"相信科学 \"忽视了科学在现实世界中并不总是一个完全遵循的过程，甚至可能是危险的。","the_new_excerpt":"(这与COVID有半点关系，因为这个论点经常出现，但我也见过在对同行的回应中出现这种情况。\n在回答质疑气候变化的人时，我也看到了这个问题。\n进化论等）。\n\n我理解对专家的信任更多的是一种概率的衡量标准，是大多数人不可避免的事实的一个拐杖。\n我理解对专家的信任更多的是对概率的衡量，以及对大多数人不可避免的事实的一个拐杖，因为他们会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"相信科學 \"忽視了科學在現實世界中並不總是一個完全遵循的過程，甚至可能是危險的。","the_new_excerpt":"(這與COVID有半點關係，因爲這個論點經常出現，但我也見過在對同行的迴應中出現這種情況。\n在回答質疑氣候變化的人時，我也看到了這個問題。\n進化論等）。\n\n我理解對專家的信任更多的是一種概率的衡量標準，是大多數人不可避免的事實的一個柺杖。\n我理解對專家的信任更多的是對概率的衡量，以及對大多數人不可避免的事實的一個柺杖，因爲他們會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qowtws","excerpt":"I am done with the web and searching for content on it.
