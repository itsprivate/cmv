One of our C level executives stated no political talk at work. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that politics can be heated, and people have very strong opinions.  But the key is to be respectful when having these conversations. </p>\n\n<p>I think the ban on political discussions harms us because it allows us to create strawmen that the &quot;other&quot; side believes in, which we can then argue against unopposed.  We never get to find the common ground many of us share since we don&#39;t have the conversation. </p>\n\n<p>I thought I knew politics pretty well until I was challenged by someone from the other side. When I was left to find the data to back up my beliefs, it wasn&#39;t as strong as I assumed it would be. When the person who challenged me pointed out that things I thought about their side were not accurate, my political view changed dramatically. </p>\n\n<p>I have found lots of common ground with people who I&#39;ve always felt were my polar opposites. We don&#39;t necessarily agree on policy solutions, but we are finding agreement in identifying problems that need to be resolved. It&#39;s working with people on a common goal that helps us find solutions. </p>\n\n<p>Also, life experience matters. I grew up in a suburban middle class neighborhood. That clouds my view. When I read about homophobic Christians, I&#39;m at a loss. I was raised going to church, and I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever noticed such a thing. But I believe it to be real, just outside of my life experience. But these are things we get to put into perspective by talking with our family, friends and co-workers. </p>\n\n<p>Having a conversation with a redditor who grew up in one of those homophobic christian households, gave me a perspective that was valuable. I found the interaction with someone outside of my bubble to be very enlightening.  I&#39;m not converted to their view, but I have a much better understanding of their perspective. </p>\n\n<p>But online conversations won&#39;t cut it. We are instantly hostile to others, and quickly discount their views. Text on a screen doesn&#39;t have the same impact as words from mouths.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qlbruj/cmv_dont_talk_politics_is_more_harmful_than/","title":"CMV: \"Don't talk politics\" is more harmful, than helpful","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"November 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-03T00:53:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-03 00:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qlbruj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qlbruj/cmv_dont_talk_politics_is_more_harmful_than/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qlbruj/cmv_dont_talk_politics_is_more_harmful_than/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"responsible4self","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/responsible4self","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"responsible4self","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: \"Don't talk politics \"は役に立つというよりも害になる","the_new_excerpt":"私の母は、家では政治の話をしないことを徹底しています。あるC\n幹部の一人は、職場では政治的な話をしないと言っています。\n\n政治の話は白熱しますし、人々は非常に強い意見を持っていることは理解できます。\nしかし、重要なのは、このような会話をするときに敬意を払うことです。\n\n私は、この禁止令は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：\"不要谈论政治 \"是有害的，而不是有益的","the_new_excerpt":"我母亲非常坚持不在家里谈论政治。我们的一位C\n级别的高管表示，在工作中不谈政治。\n\n我明白，政治可能是激烈的，人们有非常强烈的意见。\n但关键是在进行这些谈话时要尊重他人。\n\n我认为禁止...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"不要談論政治 \"是有害的，而不是有益的","the_new_excerpt":"我母親非常堅持不在家裏談論政治。我們的一位C\n級別的高管表示，在工作中不談政治。\n\n我明白，政治可能是激烈的，人們有非常強烈的意見。\n但關鍵是在進行這些談話時要尊重他人。\n\n我認爲禁止...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qlcsj1","excerpt":"I’m not talking about taxes on luxury goods or unhealthy items like tobacco.
