This may seem semantic but I think the distinction is important and blurring these lines is a pretty negative aspect of current political discourse. Let’s start with the definitions.</p>\n\n<p>Need: anything a human being needs to reasonably sustain themself or function normally. Examples would be food, shelter, and water at a basic level, and could be extrapolated to healthcare at a less basic but still essential level.</p>\n\n<p>Right: rights are inherent conditions which every person is born with in the context of enlightenment thought, where it was reasoned that every individual has inherent value and liberty from infringement of their processes. Freedom of speech might be the most apt example, as you are inherently born with the ability to speak, and this the only way to deprive you of this would be through force or coercion. This does not mean people are not born into oppressive circumstances, obviously they are, but that is a condition forced upon them, not their inherent state at birth. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s the important distinction: you can’t be born with all the food and water you’d ever need, so it is not inherent by any means. It has to be procured or provided. You can provide it yourself maybe, or it can be given or sold to you, but it cannot be generated out of thin air, so there is labor involved. To claim you have the right to water, for instance, is to claim also that you have the right to someone’s labor in providing you with water. You could seek water yourself, but if it is a fundamental right, then it couldn’t possibly be expected for you to only provide it for yourself. This extends to healthcare and any other product or service you can imagine. </p>\n\n<p>Yes you NEED these things, and maybe you want to arrange society in a way which more readily provides these things to people in need, but they can’t be rights without you also having the right to someone else’s labor in providing. </p>\n\n<p>Final points: there’s also legalistic rights, like “this house will be passed onto my son upon my death” kind of thing, but that’s just an extension of property rights. You have a right to the pursuit of property inherently because you have the natural ability to work to produce things. You can either create your own property or exchange for it, but you would never have the right to property without either producing, exchanging, or being given something. </p>\n\n<p>If you think the government should provide basic needs, then fine. That’s called an entitlement. It’s not a right. It’s an acknowledgement that you are entitled to the production and provision of “x” amount of a good. We should stop referring to these things as rights.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q9hqk9/cmv_there_is_a_fundamental_difference_between/","title":"CMV: There is a fundamental difference between human rights and human needs","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-17T13:30:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-17 13:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q9hqk9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q9hqk9/cmv_there_is_a_fundamental_difference_between/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q9hqk9/cmv_there_is_a_fundamental_difference_between/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Arcani63","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arcani63","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Arcani63","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 「人権」と「ニーズ」は根本的に違います","the_new_excerpt":"医療、食料、水は人間の基本的なニーズであり、権利ではありません。これは意味深に見えるかもしれませんが\nこの境界線を曖昧にしてしまうことは、現在のPeopleの\nこの境界線を曖昧にすることは、現在の政治的言説のかなり否定的な側面です。まず、定義から始めましょう。\n定義から始めましょう。\n\n必要：人間が合理的に維持するために必要なもの...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：人权和人类需求之间有一个根本的区别","the_new_excerpt":"保健、食物、水是人类的基本需求，而不是权利。这可能看起来\n语义，但我认为这种区别是很重要的，模糊这些界限是当前政治讨论的一个相当消极的方面。\n模糊这些界限是当前政治讨论的一个相当消极的方面。让我们从\n定义。\n\n需要：人类需要的任何东西，以合理地维持...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：人權和人類需求之間有一個根本的區別","the_new_excerpt":"保健、食物、水是人類的基本需求，而不是權利。這可能看起來\n語義，但我認爲這種區別是很重要的，模糊這些界限是當前政治討論的一個相當消極的方面。\n模糊這些界限是當前政治討論的一個相當消極的方面。讓我們從\n定義。\n\n需要：人類需要的任何東西，以合理地維持...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q9goeu","excerpt":"What’s the difference between these 2 stories: 1.
