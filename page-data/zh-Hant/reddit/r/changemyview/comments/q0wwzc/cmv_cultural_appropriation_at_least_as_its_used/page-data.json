Happened a number of years ago but if you do some googling you can find this story. We had a disney princess event a few years ago. All fairly innocent, little girls all lined up dressed as their favorite princess. In attendance was a little aboriginal girl dressed as her favourite princess Elsa.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All was well until an awful woman and her two little hellspawn told this poor young girl that she couldnt be elsa because she was black and (im just quoting here, exact words those little bitches said to this poor girl were) &quot;Black is ugly&quot;. Now this incident was horribly racist, abhorrent and pissed off most of australia.... for a few minutes (within a week it was forgotten, but we were talking about it for some time). Honestly my heart goes out to that little girl, no child should have to suffer through something like that.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Few years later, the film Moana came out and the following halloween little girls rushed to dress as the latest disney princess. Only for some parents to say &quot;No only islander kids should dress as moana, the costume is cultural appropriation&quot; OH FFS that is complete BS. Let the kids be kids  if they wanna dress as something or someone let them. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I see no difference between the two cases (other than the kids and mother were unnecessarily cruel to the aboriginal girl). Little black girls should be able to dress as elsa (or snow white or anyone else) and little white girls should be able to dress as moana.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It doesnt stop at kids either. If a white dude wants an afro or dreadlocks who has the right to say &quot;ya cant do that youre not black&quot;? FFS that is racist,, its like telling a black dude he cant grow a mullet. If he wants a mullet he should wear one.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Same thing with clothes, nothing wrong with an irish woman wearing a kimono or a frenchmen wearing a toga (if drunk frat boys can wear them without pissing off the greek community then im pretty sure the french can do it too).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>End of the day folks are making a ridiculously big deal about superficial crap. If its something with actual religious or cultural significance being mocked then i&#39;d understand folks getting upset. For instance madonna wore tefillin in a music video once. Tefillin are prayer straps used by jewish men (women arent allowed according to the religion) and are only taken out for prayer. They are considered holy. Madonna wearing em for a video is disrespectful imho and does count as appropriation. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But somebody wearing a disney princess costume or a certain hairstyle is not appropriation. Cultural APPRECIATION maybe</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>CMV guys</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q0wwzc/cmv_cultural_appropriation_at_least_as_its_used/","title":"cmv: \"Cultural Appropriation\" (at least as its used today) is complete and utter bullshit, also somewhat racist","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-04T12:32:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-04 12:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q0wwzc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q0wwzc/cmv_cultural_appropriation_at_least_as_its_used/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q0wwzc/cmv_cultural_appropriation_at_least_as_its_used/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"BeBa420","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeBa420","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BeBa420","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"cmv: \"Cultural Appropriation\"(少なくとも今日使われているもの)は全くのデタラメで、やや人種差別的でもあります。","the_new_excerpt":"さて、ここでオーストラリアでのちょっとしたエピソードを紹介しましょう。何年も前の出来事ですが\nググるとこの話が出てきます。数年前にディスニー・プリンセスのイベントがありました。\n数年前のことです。無邪気な少女たちが自分の好きなお姫様の格好をして並んでいました。\n好きなお姫様の格好をして並んでいました。そこにいたのは、小さな原住民の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"cmv: \"文化挪用\"（至少在今天的使用中）是完全和彻底的胡说八道，也有些种族主义。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，这里有一个来自澳大利亚的小故事。发生在若干年前，但\n如果你做一些谷歌搜索，你可以找到这个故事。我们有一个迪斯尼公主的活动\n几年前。所有相当无辜的小女孩都排着队，打扮成她们最喜欢的公主。\n最喜欢的公主。参加活动的是一个小土著人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"cmv: \"文化挪用\"（至少在今天的使用中）是完全和徹底的胡說八道，也有些種族主義。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，這裏有一個來自澳大利亞的小故事。發生在若干年前，但\n如果你做一些谷歌搜索，你可以找到這個故事。我們有一個迪斯尼公主的活動\n幾年前。所有相當無辜的小女孩都排着隊，打扮成她們最喜歡的公主。\n最喜歡的公主。參加活動的是一個小土著人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q0ty77","excerpt":"Braids\n[https://www.byrdie.com/history-of-braids#:%7E:text=In%20relation%20to%20time%20periods,braid%20from%201644%20to%201912%3B]\nare not cultural appropriation.
