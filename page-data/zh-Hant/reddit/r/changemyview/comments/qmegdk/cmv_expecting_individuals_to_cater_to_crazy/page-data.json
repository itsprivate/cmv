Thats freaking crazy. I cant pronounce most of them to even refer to someone even if I really wanted to cause I simply can&#39;t say many of them and they confuse me on how to fit into my grammer and sentence structure (2 things I already struggle with) and I know many others who think the same. Asking is just to much. </p>\n\n<p>If you tell me to refer to you as a girl I can do that with out thinking or effort. Its something I do without thinking and have my whole life for everyone. No big deal. Same for a guy. Even Non-bianary, while I may need to think for a second or 2 before referring to you cause I struggle talking and putting words in proper order in the first place but ok not to hard. Not that much effort so I dont care. I can do that for you.</p>\n\n<p>Asking me to call you Zie, Em, Ter or what ever of you ask me to of the 78 other pronouns you chose from just messes with my head. I have to put effort in to remember this single random person now. I have to sit there and feel stupid trying to talk to or about them cause 90% of the time I cant say the pronoun. I have to remember you use a different pronoun than everyone else in my life and its confusing as hell. I have to restructure my sentences and the ways I speak to or about this person and its obnoxious. I shouldn&#39;t nor should anyone need to put that much thought or effort in for your self image. Thats for you to deal with on your own and it just feels unnecessary when you can just go by them/they as a umbrella term. Your a unicorn/tree/ Zir/ alien/ Ter/or Em. Them/ They fits you fine. Your not a guy or girl you fit even if not perfectly with them/they pronouns. And asking for that much is reasonable with people!</p>\n\n<p>Your not a girl or guy. Thats perfectly fine. Umbrella term it under them/ they pronouns. Its not perfect but asking more is a lot. Expecting people to memorize more than that is to much expectation and even more so on a stranger or someone who in all reality may think of you as little more than a coworker or just someone they happen to know/ be around. Reasonable expectations in society are important. Expecting more than He/Him/She/Her/They/Them is unreasonable.</p>\n\n<p>Update: Honestly my mind isn&#39;t 100% changed this would be a easier solution. But people are worth the effort when I care. Ive gotten a few DMs that had stories that really caused me to reevaluate. And I get its kinda a asshole thing to do. To be honest Im probably gonna just cut the friends off whom made me snap and come up with this solution in the first place. As for the 2 people in my life whom refer to themselves as dog and toy and expect more than just pronouns Im probably going to have a talk with them about it being a pain and it being to much to expect and if they cant accept it Im probably going to see them much less or just stop talking. Im ok calling people the proper gender but the simple thing is there is such thing as to much and I suppose I experienced that and thought it was normal. I didn&#39;t facor in I am a odd ball and extreamly extroverted and my problem is a bit unique as there are so many people. But I have physical issues pronouncing words and Im tired of there being no exceptions to help me there while still being called a ass. Im done with dealing with that but I understand now just cause it makes my life a tiny bit easier other than those people doesn&#39;t mean I wasnt wrong.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qmegdk/cmv_expecting_individuals_to_cater_to_crazy/","title":"CMV: Expecting individuals to cater to crazy pronouns beyond he/him/she/her/they/them is expecting to much of people.
