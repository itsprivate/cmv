Stop being so damn greedy and getting paid off by banks to allow them to do whatever they want without consequence. Companies have lost folks identity, literally stole folks identity, created false accounts, wrongly foreclosed on folks home leaving them homeless, etc. With little actual consequence to the banks whatsoever. </p>\n\n<p>Banks are now allowed as of 2020 to keep no money on reserve <strong>whatsoever</strong> from the money you give them to loan out. So they effectively can make up whatever amount and use it to gamble. It used to be that they were required to only keep 10% of money given on reserve and they could loan out or gamble 90% of the money. <strong>NOW</strong> they have no obligation and it&#39;s just a debtfest with no obligations to really make smart decisions or hold any reserves. They know they&#39;re &quot;too big to fail&quot; so no need to worry about bad decisions there. Ultimately, big daddy Uncle Sam and his nieces and nephews money will rescue you no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>Folks that argue folks losing jobs from a bank closure should instead be focused on creating programs to help those folks just like was the case with Covid. I&#39;d much rather my tax money be used to help innocent folks recover than use unlimited money to bail out banks that now go unpunished basically at the large scale instead of letting banks they may not have screwed over folks the same way thrive and having actual punishments if you choose to do dumb crap with loaned money to you. Using *<em>actual good regulations</em>&amp; keeps banks in check and stops idiocracy.</p>\n\n<p>In the present state you have things where companies have complete freedom to do whatever they like and pay like 1% or less in profits or whatever trivial number from class action lawsuits or hell just an actual bailout. With current laws/regulations (lack thereof) banks own the government if they control the resources and can force you to put money into them. Screw a budget. Won&#39;t matter every single other entity doesn&#39;t matter, because banks overrule them all if they run into trouble at all. Regardless if it&#39;s their own faults. Would love to see how folks defend this one as there are viable alternatives to &quot;too big to fail.&quot; Those should already be in the works and not just from the housing market crises.
