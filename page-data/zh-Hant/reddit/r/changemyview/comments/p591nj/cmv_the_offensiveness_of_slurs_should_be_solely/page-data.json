Nobody is in track of every wrong they have done and it makes sense that she only noticed because people brought it up”</p>\n\n<p>As an example I said “when I was 16, I said the word f****t and I didn’t recognise it could potentially hurt people until someone brought it up. Yes I wish I was smarter and just knew it was wrong but unfortunately was not. I’ve grown since then and I think it would be completely irrational for me to lose my job after apologising for something I did at 16”</p>\n\n<p>To which my friends response was “you just said it then so clearly you haven’t changed”</p>\n\n<p>Which honestly I was baffled, and responded “yeah, I used the word in and of itself, not to describe anything?”</p>\n\n<p>Finally my other friend said “I think you shouldn’t speak on peoples experiences and you should keep those opinions to yourself”</p>\n\n<p>my perspective seems to be super unpopular, I think the only thing that matters in life is intent. so I’m like is there something I’m missing? \nIsn’t forbidding saying words when literally talking about words giving it way too much power? To the point if I’m censoring texts.\nA popular stance seems to be “don’t question it just don’t say it” and I feel like I’m questioning it because I’m trying to understand, but I don’t get much of an explanation because it’s a tense topic which furthers the divide.</p>\n\n<p>I would also like to say I am NOT white. I don’t belong to the minority group the slur is associated with however, I’m middle eastern. None of my friends do either, so aren’t we all just speaking on behalf of a group that nobody is apart of?</p>\n\n<p>I believe I’m not a privileged white person who is speaking from a position where I have never felt discriminated against. If this did apply to me I’d react the same. Is my opinion really that invalid? Am I missing something?</p>\n\n<p>Most people who I’ve had encounters with them being sensitive at stuff like cultural appropriation, so VERY similar things themselves but don’t care when they’re the ones doing things against other races</p>\n\n<p>-using different slurs and thinking it’s okay like they won’t say n***** but they will call things gay(um can I say that?).\n-will be against cultural appropriation of some races and not others, like they’ll be against people wearing box braids but they’ll believe that people who believe the fox eye trend appropriates asian features is a stretch.</p>\n\n<p>I believe there’s a lot of nitpicking going on where it’s to a standard nobody can say they’ve upheld, so it’s unfair to berate people for things they did in ignorance, I also think this stuff belittles real racism where people actively just hate each other.</p>\n\n<p>I do understand that if someone tells you to not say something because they are uncomfortable with it, no matter what the word. It’s disrespectful to use it around them knowing they are uncomfortable. It’s why I’ll censor words despite thinking it’s a bit irrational.but that’s a) after you’ve learnt and b) in their presence.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote that I kind of answered my own question because I guess the celebrity was technically in the presence of the internet, thus publicly saying it. But it still stands that it was in ignorance at first. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, there’s no way to talk about this without people labelling me a piece of shit. But I DO want to understand, I’m sorry if my questioning seems dismissive/ attacking. But clearly there is something I’m not getting that I trying to.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Is it wrong to speak/text non directed slurs?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nJust an update i guess since things are just being repeated at this point.\nReformed belief: To the question &quot;Is it wrong to speak/text non directed slurs?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"/r/LadyCardinal\">r/LadyCardinal</a>, i understand that slurs should not be used casually, despite non-malicious intent. Because it may bring up trauma for some people. Avoiding the word shows validity and understanding towards those effected. So overall i was wrong in thinking that the word&#39;s impact is purely contextual.</p>\n\n<p>I do still believe people who have used slurs in ignorance should&#39;t be ostracised, but instead educated. and that most people have a very dogmatic approach when discussing this topic.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the comments below i understood and agreed with, but they were beliefs i already held. Such as the belief that regardless of personal belief on the impact of a word, it is antisocial behaviour to be so determined to do something that generally upsets people.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely do feel like i learnt something. I think arguments can be alienating when you don&#39;t understand why there&#39;s a clash in beliefs and understanding why helps people feel a little more connected. I sure do.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all your responses!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/p591nj/cmv_the_offensiveness_of_slurs_should_be_solely/","title":"CMV: the offensiveness of slurs should be solely based on context","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-16T11:47:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-16 11:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p591nj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p591nj/cmv_the_offensiveness_of_slurs_should_be_solely/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p591nj/cmv_the_offensiveness_of_slurs_should_be_solely/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"FckMiDed","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FckMiDed","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"FckMiDed","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 誹謗中傷の不快さは文脈にのみ基づいて判断されるべきである","the_new_excerpt":"私と友人は、ある有名人が他の人の曲の中で中傷的な言葉を言ったことについて議論していました。\n彼女は18歳になって謝罪しました。\n\n私の友人は、「彼女は16歳の時にもっとよく知っておくべきだった、人種差別的だと知っていた。\nそれを言った彼女は人種差別者であり、キャンセルされたからといって気にすることはない」というものでした。\nキャンセルされるから気にしているだけだ」というものでした。\n\n私の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：诽谤的冒犯性应完全基于上下文","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友们正在讨论一些名人如何在16岁时在另一个人的歌曲中说了一句脏话。\n我和我的朋友们在讨论一些名人如何在16岁时在另一个人的歌曲中说了一句脏话，她在18岁时道歉了。\n\n我的朋友的立场是：\"她在16岁时就应该知道，她知道那是种族主义，她说这句话是种族主义，而且只关心她是否知道，因为她正在获得报酬。\n种族主义者，她说这句话是种族主义者，而且只关心她是否知道，因为她被取消了。\n被取消\"\n\n我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：誹謗的冒犯性應完全基於上下文","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友們正在討論一些名人如何在16歲時在另一個人的歌曲中說了一句髒話。\n我和我的朋友們在討論一些名人如何在16歲時在另一個人的歌曲中說了一句髒話，她在18歲時道歉了。\n\n我的朋友的立場是：\"她在16歲時就應該知道，她知道那是種族主義，她說這句話是種族主義，而且只關心她是否知道，因爲她正在獲得報酬。\n種族主義者，她說這句話是種族主義者，而且只關心她是否知道，因爲她被取消了。\n被取消\"\n\n我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p53er2","excerpt":"Most Americans are familiar with the process by which you overpay your taxes\nthroughout the year from each paycheck, and then come tax filing time, you\nreceive a refund from the government equal to the amount you overpaid.\n\nBut if you think about it, all you did was loan your money to the government…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/p53er2/cmv_the_government_should_pay_interest_on_our_tax/","title":"CMV: The government should pay interest on our tax refunds since they hold them for a year.","date":"August 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 政府は還付金を1年間保管しているのだから、利息をつけるべきだ。","the_new_excerpt":"ほとんどのアメリカ人は、税金を払いすぎた時のプロセスを知っています。\n一年を通して給料日ごとに税金を払いすぎて、確定申告の時期になると\nそして確定申告の時期になると、払いすぎた金額と同じ額の還付金を政府から受け取ることができます。\n\nしかし、考えてみれば、あなたがしたことは、自分のお金を政府に貸しただけなのです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：政府应该为我们的退税支付利息，因为他们持有一年的退税。","the_new_excerpt":"大多数美国人都熟悉你多付税款的过程。\n在整个一年中，你从每份工资中多付了税款，然后在报税时间，你会从政府那里收到相当于你多付的金额的退款。\n然后在报税的时候，你会从政府那里收到与你多付的金额相等的退款。\n\n但是，如果你仔细想想，你所做的只是把你的钱借给政府...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：政府應該爲我們的退稅支付利息，因爲他們持有一年的退稅。","the_new_excerpt":"大多數美國人都熟悉你多付稅款的過程。\n在整個一年中，你從每份工資中多付了稅款，然後在報稅時間，你會從政府那裏收到相當於你多付的金額的退款。\n然後在報稅的時候，你會從政府那裏收到與你多付的金額相等的退款。\n\n但是，如果你仔細想想，你所做的只是把你的錢借給政府...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-p5dfib","excerpt":"When choosing a vehicle to purchase or when choosing how to customize your\nvehicle, you have options.
