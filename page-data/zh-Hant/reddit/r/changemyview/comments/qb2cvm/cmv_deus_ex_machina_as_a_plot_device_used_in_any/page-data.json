For example Toy Story 3, the cast is being pulled down into the burn pit, they have accepted their fate and realized there&#39;s nothing that they can do about it, but then the aliens bring forth the giant claw that they worship to save them. It was funny and it was a throwback to the original movie so it fits.</p>\n\n<p>But seriously why should I even care about a story if god, or coincidence, or someone with unknown superpowers or whatever comes up and saves the Day and likely could have done so to prevent the entirety of the story from ever happening.</p>\n\n<p>And yeah I get it, it&#39;s about the journey, but it&#39;s kind of like with Lord of the rings why didn&#39;t they just fly the eagle to Mordor instead of trekking for three whole books? And I&#39;m sure at some point that was actually answered, I just don&#39;t know the answer if there is when I&#39;m just using it as an example. But then I also think of Batman versus superman, the only reason that got resolved was instead of talking about their problems like any two adults would they nearly killed each other only to find out their mothers both named Martha. I refuse to watch that movie because of that horrible climax.</p>\n\n<p>And now I don&#39;t mind stories where the thing that saves them is something that had been noticeably or understandably being worked around in the background by other characters or even the protagonist themselves. Like in The hunger games catching fire when the coach whose name I forget comes and saves the crew while they are in their hunger game match you knew that was happening in the background that didn&#39;t come out of nowhere you can understand why that happened, and it also led to significantly more story as to the consequences of that occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly just think in modern media it needs to be phased out of anything that&#39;s meant to be serious, I mean I play D&amp;D and if God just came and fixed our problems I&#39;d be pissed because like I said before why didn&#39;t they do it earlier? But that&#39;s beside the point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qb2cvm/cmv_deus_ex_machina_as_a_plot_device_used_in_any/","title":"CMV: Deus ex machina as a plot device used in any media that is not meant to be comedic is an insult to anyone who is invested in the story.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-19T09:39:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-19 09:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qb2cvm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qb2cvm/cmv_deus_ex_machina_as_a_plot_device_used_in_any/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qb2cvm/cmv_deus_ex_machina_as_a_plot_device_used_in_any/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"PurpleGodandViolet","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PurpleGodandViolet","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PurpleGodandViolet","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: Deus ex machina（デウス・エクス・マキナ）は、コメディを目的としないあらゆるメディアで使われるプロットデバイスで、ストーリーに投資している人への侮辱です。","the_new_excerpt":"主人公が壁に背を向けているような状況では、何度も見てきました。\n主人公が壁に背を向け、状況は悲惨で、逃げ場がないように見え、すべての希望が失われているような状況を何度も見てきました。\nどんな状況でも、主人公が壁に追い込まれ、逃げ場がなく、希望を失った時に、主人公やその場にいた人とは全く関係のない奇跡が訪れて\n主人公やその場にいた人の行動とは全く関係のない奇跡が訪れ、救われる...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：作为一种情节装置，在任何非喜剧性的媒体中使用都是对投入故事的人的侮辱。","the_new_excerpt":"我见过很多次，在任何情况下，主人公都是背对着墙的，情况很糟糕，似乎没有办法。\n在任何情况下，主人公背靠着墙，形势严峻，似乎无路可逃。\n所有的希望都破灭了，但随后出现了与主角的行为无关的奇迹。\n但是，一个与主人公或处境中的任何人的行为无关的奇迹出现了，拯救了......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：作爲一種情節裝置，在任何非喜劇性的媒體中使用都是對投入故事的人的侮辱。","the_new_excerpt":"我見過很多次，在任何情況下，主人公都是背對着牆的，情況很糟糕，似乎沒有辦法。\n在任何情況下，主人公背靠着牆，形勢嚴峻，似乎無路可逃。\n所有的希望都破滅了，但隨後出現了與主角的行爲無關的奇蹟。\n但是，一個與主人公或處境中的任何人的行爲無關的奇蹟出現了，拯救了......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qb48d5","excerpt":"Before you get your pitchforks ready, this isn't a thinly-veiled transphobic\nrant.\n\nGender is something that's come up a lot more in recent discussions(within the\nlast 5 years or so), and a frequent refrain is that gender is a social\nconstruct, because different cultures have different…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qb48d5/cmv_gender_is_not_a_social_construct_gender/","title":"CMV: Gender is not a social construct, gender expression is","date":"October 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 性別は社会的構成要素ではなく、性別表現は","the_new_excerpt":"この記事は、トランスフォビア（性的少数者）を揶揄するものではありません。\nではありません。\n\nジェンダーについては、最近の議論の中でもよく取り上げられています。\nこの5年ほどの間に、ジェンダーは社会的な構成要素であるということがよく言われるようになりました。\nなぜなら、異なる文化には異なる...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：性别不是一种社会结构，性别表达才是。","the_new_excerpt":"在你们准备好干草叉之前，这并不是一个薄薄的变性人言论。\n咆哮。\n\n性别问题在最近的讨论中出现得更多了（在过去五年左右）。\n过去5年左右），一个经常出现的说法是，性别是一种社会结构。\n因为不同的文化背景有不同的性别。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：性別不是一種社會結構，性別表達纔是。","the_new_excerpt":"在你們準備好乾草叉之前，這並不是一個薄薄的變性人言論。\n咆哮。\n\n性別問題在最近的討論中出現得更多了（在過去五年左右）。\n過去5年左右），一個經常出現的說法是，性別是一種社會結構。\n因爲不同的文化背景有不同的性別。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qbdo8f","excerpt":"Here is what I understand about Israel's situation.
