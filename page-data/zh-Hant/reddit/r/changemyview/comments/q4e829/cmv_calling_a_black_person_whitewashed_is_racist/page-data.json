They also make it seem like the reason they don&#39;t speak AAVE is because they&#39;re embarrassed by it, while the most likely case is that they just weren&#39;t raised speaking it. These also aren&#39;t small comments, I&#39;ve seen a few with 10 thousand plus likes.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I&#39;ve seen is if a black person is with a group of white people the comments will be like why is he hanging out with white people, does he not have black friends, thats real suspicious. As if a black person can&#39;t have white friends because if they do then they&#39;re whitewashed.</p>\n\n<p>Probably the worst example I saw was this black girl that was adopted by a white family. She got horribly bullied by people on tiktok untill she deleted her vids. They were saying that she couldn&#39;t ACTUALLY be black, that she was being indoctrinated with racist white ideals, and that her family only adopted her for diversity points.</p>\n\n<p>This all seems incredibly racist to me, but whenever I try to point it out I just get slammed with insults and people saying that a white boy obviously wouldn&#39;t get it, and maybe I don&#39;t, that is why I&#39;m here after all. Basically I&#39;m looking for somone to explain to me how saying that because a black person talks a certain way, has a certain political view, was raised a certain way etc... isn&#39;t racist, and if it&#39;s not then what is it. Or also if you&#39;ve seen it used to refer to a black person in a non racist way.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so as was pointed out to me this is colorism, not racism. I still think that this is overall detrimental to the black community despite it not being racism its still discriminatory.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q4e829/cmv_calling_a_black_person_whitewashed_is_racist/","title":"Cmv: calling a black person whitewashed is racist.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-09T13:34:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-09 13:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q4e829","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q4e829/cmv_calling_a_black_person_whitewashed_is_racist/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q4e829/cmv_calling_a_black_person_whitewashed_is_racist/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Impossible_Coffee_37","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible_Coffee_37","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Impossible_Coffee_37","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Cmv：黒人をホワイトウォッシュと呼ぶのは差別です。","the_new_excerpt":"(既に話題になっていたらリンクしてください😁)\n\ntiktokをよく見ていると、黒人の人が「ちゃんと」話しているビデオがありますよね。\n基本的にはAAVEではなく、「ちゃんと」話している黒人のビデオがあると、何百ものコメントが寄せられます。\n白人に選ばれたのか？\n彼らはまた...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Cmv：说黑人洗白是种族主义者。","the_new_excerpt":"(如果这个问题已经被讨论过了，请链接它😁)\n\n我经常上tiktok，会有一个视频，里面有一个黑人\n适当的 \"谈话\"，基本上不是AAVE，就会有数百条评论\n说他们被洗白了，问他们是否已经被白人 \"选中\"。\n他们还...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cmv：說黑人洗白是種族主義者。","the_new_excerpt":"(如果這個問題已經被討論過了，請鏈接它😁)\n\n我經常上tiktok，會有一個視頻，裏面有一個黑人\n適當的 \"談話\"，基本上不是AAVE，就會有數百條評論\n說他們被洗白了，問他們是否已經被白人 \"選中\"。\n他們還...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q4hi1c","excerpt":"\"but you agreed to in in the ToS\" shut up.
