In this context, that means identifying the person in question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically any time a signature is used. it&amp;#39;s purpose is useless. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A signature at the bottom of a formal email, next to their name and contact information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A legal document or &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; document, like something signed by a university, with a chairman head&amp;#39;s signature at the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any document or form YOU sign where you include your signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, a signature can be faked very easily either digitally or by faking it yourself with some practice - Any remotely talented penman could fake almost any signature with enough practice, so simple put, absolutely nothing about a signature confirms that the person who claimed they wrote something actually wrote it. Moreover, it&amp;#39;s not like signatures are a very good way of identifying people in the first place, seeing as most devolve into something you can&amp;#39;t read, and in a sea of millions of people, there is surely lots of many overlaps by many. I&amp;#39;ve seen signatures that have literally devolved into just a squiggle with no letters! Others look like circles. In theory, it can be anything. It&amp;#39;s such a poorly contrived security system that I think people know actually doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything -- It&amp;#39;s the same reason why I just filled out a form for the dentist and my signature came out terrible and incoherent, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter and I didn&amp;#39;t care, nor did the dentists&amp;#39; office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the only practical use of signatures is to scare people into agreement / convince people that under this arbitrary system, a signature means something so if you signed off on it, you&amp;#39;re obligated to be honest and in agreement. Realistically it has never meant anything. Programs like Docusign just let you copy and paste signatures from a given selection of handwriting! And of course, any mobile form of a signature, over mouse or touch screen, is usually quite different than the real thing in writing. Signatures and their existence are one of many reasons things like back cheques are insecure and can be faked -- If we used something else like fingerprints via special ink types and whatnot, we&amp;#39;d probably be much better off - Plus, fingerprints are already stored by the police and whatnot, and are much harder to fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: To anyone saying that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s used so technically it isn&amp;#39;t useless&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m aware of that and me mentioning it being useless is more of a juxtoposition of it not being useFUL because it&amp;#39;s ineffective. Something useless can be defined as something not used OR something &amp;quot;not fulfilling or not expected to achieve the intended purpose or desired outcome&amp;quot; which is the meaning I intend here.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Someone actually disagreeing with this point brought up some very pertinent information:&lt;br/&gt;
Apparently, &amp;quot;experts can correctly identify 95% of &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; signatures, and correctly reject 71% of forgeries&amp;quot;. This is proof of how ineffective signatures are at identifying who wrote them! 30% failure rate is ABYSMAL! And that&amp;#39;s by experts, wow. One could only wonder what it would be like among people who have no training, or have minimal training - They&amp;#39;d probably have a failure rate of well over 60%, because signatures empart NO information that varifies who wrote them&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#39;t arrived at the view I&amp;#39;m about to outline through research, but simply through thinking about it. The reason I&amp;#39;m making this post is to hopefully hear from people who have a better grasp on this stuff than me. I&amp;#39;m here for a productive and insightful discussion, not a debate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my understanding of the gender pay gap is that there&amp;#39;s a fairly significant ( ≈21% in the US) disparity in how much men and women are paid that can mostly be chalked up to differing career choices, levels of education and time taken off work for pregnancy and childcare. I think this is an objective fact pretty much everyone can get on board with. The divisive bit comes in once you account for the factors I mentioned above and are still left with a meaningful disparity (≈5% in the US). Feminists tend to say this remaining disparity is a result of pure misogyny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m of the opinion that the entire pay gap is a problem, but especially the adjusted bit. That&amp;#39;s because even though the majority of the disparity probably isn&amp;#39;t the result of employers explicitly choosing to pay men more than women, it&amp;#39;s still the result of patriarchal cultural factors, such as parents encouraging their sons to go to college but not their daughters. Also, I wonder how much of the &amp;quot;different career choices&amp;quot; can be attributed to women leaving competitive, high-earning fields of work due to harassment in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have a feeling that an awful lot of those patriarchal cultural factors I alluded to stem from the fact that women generally need to take time off work as a result of childrearing and men don&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s why I think the best thing we can do to meaningfully lower the gender pay gap is to promote paternity leave, both through cultural and legislative means. Ideally, I think every single person on earth should be entitled to at least 12 paid weeks off work upon childbirth or adoption. I realise many first world countries don&amp;#39;t even guarantee paid maternity leave yet though, so I&amp;#39;m willing to set the net a little lower for a start. I&amp;#39;m not going to specify exactly what changes I want to be made because that would vary wildly from country to country, so I&amp;#39;ll let you just go after my logic here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this would greatly improve the pay gap situation (both the unadjusted and adjusted portions) as well as lead to societal improvements in other areas. For instance, I think it could lead to a decrease in men abandoning their children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I don&amp;#39;t mind maternity leave still being slightly longer than paternity leave, at least in cases that don&amp;#39;t involve adoption or surrogacy, considering pregnancy and breastfeeding are a thing. But I do think the aforementioned minimum 12 paid weeks for either parent would be a good thing to aim for in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: I haven&amp;#39;t abandoned the thread. I&amp;#39;ll be back in about an hour and continue replying to comments.&lt;/p&gt;

Both of them are relatively young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He  filed for divorce and obtained it, but since then he has to pay child  support which comes out as more than half his paycheck. Plus he has rent  and bills to pay. He challenged it in a court of law but ended up  losing the legal battle due to a number of circumstances. Long story  short, it was determined that he is the best candidate to provide the  kids a confortable upbringing and that he was not allowed to conduct a  DNA test on his child without the consent of the mother as well (and was  fined for that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has made it clear that he does not want ties to his previous family and has changed city and job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  find it unfair towards him and other people in his same situation. In  this case, the real father should step up and take responsibilities for  what he has done instead of being able to walk out free. Furthermore,  the mother should also be liable of some sort of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of  course, the wellness of the children matters. But this is way we pay  taxes. is it not? So that the state could support the less fortunate of  us and give them a fighting chance? Why should anyone be paying more to  contribute to the upbringing of children that are not his? What do they  have that is so special in respect to some other random orphan kid who  will do years in an temporary accomodation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let  us allocate more of our budget towards creating a safety net for this  unlucky kids instead of torturing a poor guy to a life of 1€ meals,  shared accomodation and no savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT the reduction of his check is not just because of child support but also because he needed to pay all the expenses in his court case and also he has to pay his now ex wife monthly until she marries again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it&amp;#39;s a fairly commonly held belief especially among relatively young people that not only is there probably some intelligent life out there, but that there is certainly tons of it. While I think it is certainly possible and even likely given the vastness of the universe, the idea that it is clear that numerous super advanced extraterrestrial civilizations exist is unconvincing to me. My view primarly hinges on dissecting the Drake Equation, which I feel is one of the main arguments coming from people with this belief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don&amp;#39;t know, the Drake equation is a model designed to predict the number of civilizations with which humans could communicate (i.e the number of alien worlds with technology similar or more advanced than ours in our galaxy alone). The equation asserts that this number is the product of mean rate of star formation, fraction of stars w/ planets, mean # of planets that could support life per star w/ planets, fraction of habitable planets that have life, fraction of planets w/ life that develop intelligent life, fraction of planets w/ intelligent life that develop communication, and mean length of time that civilizations can communicate. I actually am mostly ok with the model itself. I think that if the correct values were used, this model might be able to predict the proper number of advanced civilizations within a couple orders of magnitude. However, the values traditionally used for these parameters render a completely psuedo-scientific result. The following values are those which were orginally estimated by Drake himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean rate of star formation&lt;/strong&gt;- Set by Drake as 1 per year, I&amp;#39;m no astronomer but this is something we apparently have sufficient evidence for and is regarded as a conservative estimate. This value is totally fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraction of stars with planets&lt;/strong&gt;- Estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.5. Also something we have evidence for, fine by me. I actually thought this number was considered to be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planets that could support life per star with planets&lt;/strong&gt;- Estimated to be between 1 and 5. This is completely baseless. Given that we have never been able to successfully recreate abiogenesis, and we only really have evidence that it has ever taken place once on Earth, I do not see a compelling reason to believe that the true value is greater than something like 10^-9. There is really nothing to suggest that life is nearly as common as this estimate asserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraction of these planets that will develop life&lt;/strong&gt;- Estimated as 100%. I guess the idea is that over billions of years, anything that could happen will almost certainly happen. However, this doesn&amp;#39;t take into account the fact that the ability to support life and the ability to start life are entirely different. For example, a major hypothesis about abiogenesis is that it arose from lightning. It is entirely possible if not likely that a given planet with the elemental building blocks of life and proper temperature range would not have the required forces to precipitate abiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraction of planets with life that will develop intelligent life&lt;/strong&gt;- This is the one I have the biggest problem with, as it is also set as 100%. This presupposes that there is something inevitable about intelligent life, something intrinsic to the process of natural selection that moves species towards intelligence over many generations. However there is really no evidence for this and it even goes against modern ideas of how evolution works. One of the last lines of Darwin&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;On the Origin of Species&amp;quot; asserts that &amp;quot;all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection&amp;quot;. But we know now that this is not the case. Organisms adapt to the conditions of their surroundings, and more often than not intelligence is not an adaptive trait as it is costly in terms of energy and does not benefit a species that cannot utilize it. Primates, given the structure of their body, were in a unique position to benefit from intelligence as they were capable of physically manipulating their environment. It even appears to be the case that multicellular life arising from single cell life is quite rare, as we only have observed it successfully occuring once on our planet. So many specific selective pressures had to be enforced to give the Homo genus their paramount intelligence that this number is likely far closer to 0% than it is to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraction of planets with intelligent life that will develop sufficient communication systems&lt;/strong&gt;- At 10 to 20%, this estimate is less egregious than the others but I would still argue it is too high. Again, there is nothing inherent or inevitable about the factors that lead to advanced technology. There is no reason to believe that intelligent beings necessarily organize themselves in such a way that such technological advancement is possible or desirable. Hunter-gatherer cultures for example do not tend towards industrialization or even the type of labor specialization required to create advanced technology. Additionally, even if a planet has intelligent life, why does this mean it must also have the requisite resources for communication systems. Such technology requires enormous amounts of energy. The industrialization that took place on our own planet was only possible due to the Carboniferous as well as the presence of large quantities of heavy metals such as iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years that such civilizations will be able to communicate&lt;/strong&gt;- Estimated to be between 1000 and 100,000,000 years. The lower bound is plausible enough though the upper bound feels ludicrously high. There is no evidence of how long such a civilization will last. However, I don&amp;#39;t have a well backed argument for a much lower value so I will accept &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these numbers, we find that Drake predicted between 20 and 50,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way with which humans could communicate. People use this result as evidence or advanced extraterrestrial life but as I believe I have demonstrated, the values used render this estimate far too high. If we use my values rather than Drake&amp;#39;s, we would estimate less than once advanced civilization in the Milky Way, thus indicating that it is by no means obvious that intelligent life is widely or even somewhat present outside of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my view changed as there appear to be plenty of intelligent, well credentialed people who believe that many, many advanced civilizations exist. I have never really encountered someone who agrees with me on this so I feel that I must be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is 5 years old, as of yesterday, but he’s been enrolled in a transitional kindergarten program at the local elementary school as he was too young at the beginning of the school year to enroll in kindergarten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 4, and now 5, as presumably it won’t change, he gets daily homework, and weekend homework, and he got a rather large homework packet for the thanksgiving break as well. This all comes back graded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, none of this homework is hard, but this is all relative as well, and he doesn’t understand the concept of grading either, but all the parents do. The homework consists of about 90 minutes worth of work for a 4-5 year old (assuming they can concentrate straight through, this is highly unlikely in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a few weeks ago his school didn’t have a TK teacher and he was just put into a kindergarten class along with all the other TK students. They’re still short a TK teacher, and this thanksgiving homework packet was labeled “kindergarten” and had activities that frankly we had to just, well, do for him because they were way beyond him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: I just got done dropping off my son at school (8:15AM EST) and his teacher said that the thanksgiving packet that was sent home was a mistake made by a substitute teacher and none of the children should have been expected to complete it. It was far too advanced for TK level, he actually did most of it fairly well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps this is just laziness and not the norm. After all I don’t have a plethora of kids in different schools. The packet took about 2 hours per day over 1 week. It would have taken longer if I hadn’t given up trying to teach him things that were way over his head that he hasn’t even begun learning in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think this is ridiculous for this age group. CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term is completely unpronounceable in Spanish the way that people intend for it to be pronounced. If the people for whom the word is intended cannot even pronounce it, then it is not an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Latino” is gender neutral in Spanish already but if that is unacceptable because of its masculine inclination for some people then there are other alternatives that are easier to pronounce such as “Latine” and “Latin.” In Spanish, it is understood that “Latino” is gender neutral and it does not have the sexist connotation that English-speakers assume it does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term is largely pushed by progressive white Americans against the will of the Latino community in the US. Only 3% of Latinos in the US identify with the term according to the Pew Research Center, the vast majority have not even heard of it, and amongst those who have their view of it is overwhelmingly negative. They see it as a white Western attempt to disrespect the rules of the Spanish language for politicized means, which is linguistic imperialism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people who actually use the term being so small, it should not be used as the default for all Latinos unlike what corporations and politicians in the US are doing. If you know someone identifies as a woman or a man just call them Latino or Latina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often say people are the authors of their own experience and this is a central tenet of progressivism especially for the marginalized. So why are people NOT listening to the majority of Latinos who do not want to be called Latinx? It screams “we know what is better for you than you know for yourself so sit back and shut up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like &amp;quot;oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then&amp;quot;, I don&amp;#39;t see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other arguments I hear are &amp;quot;muh government telling us to do things bad&amp;quot;, to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can&amp;#39;t do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I&amp;#39;ve heard good argument for why kids shouldn&amp;#39;t wear them, although those argument are stuff like &amp;quot;they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s child abuse&amp;quot; or some stupid shit like that. I think teenagers should have to wear them too though, this would only apply to young kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a strange perspective. I have friends because we share specific hobbies or have known each other since we were kids. Romantic relationships are a different thing. I&amp;#39;ve had women say they just want to be friends and I just politely said &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s ok I&amp;#39;m just looking for a romantic partner right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s weird that people feel that friendship is the foundation and you build romance on top of that. Of course I&amp;#39;m friends with my wife, but if we weren&amp;#39;t together then I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this: if you have a young child, would you spend time with them if they weren&amp;#39;t your child? I&amp;#39;m not saying you wouldn&amp;#39;t enjoy spending time with kids if they aren&amp;#39;t yours, but would you specifically set up time to hang out them? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have friends the same age as your parents? Or do you only have that relationship with them &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are your parents? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an insult to not be friends with someone. I&amp;#39;m not friends with a lot of people I would probably enjoy spending time with. The reality is I just have a few spaces in my life for important people. I wouldn&amp;#39;t go around treating kids like my own child just like I wouldn&amp;#39;t go around talking about my feelings with women who aren&amp;#39;t my wife. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying men and women can&amp;#39;t be friends. That&amp;#39;s not the claim. I&amp;#39;m saying friends and other catagories aren&amp;#39;t the same. I don&amp;#39;t look for the same thing from friends that I do from a parent or a spouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now obviously, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with seeing someone as just a friend. But you can&amp;#39;t decide they have to see you the same way and not leave when they find out you don&amp;#39;t like them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m interested in someone sexually and they aren&amp;#39;t into me. I don&amp;#39;t want to see them anymore. I&amp;#39;m not angry about it, but if someone specifically tells me I&amp;#39;m not what they want, why would I want to spend time with them? If we were already friends for a while sure, but if it&amp;#39;s always been a romantic potential for me then no romance = I&amp;#39;m out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only have so much time for each person in our lives. As well as work and self care, meditation, hobbies, etc. If you don&amp;#39;t want to be in the one catagory I&amp;#39;m hiring for, then there&amp;#39;s no open positions at this time. And honestly it should go vice versa. Why you would want to be friends with someone who wants to date you is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;

So i only have a partial experience of the things I&amp;#39;ll be talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanna say that i entirely acknowledge the fact that some people have a harder life than others due to societal factors; It&amp;#39;s obvious to me that being white, cisgender, straight and born in a developped country makes one a lot less susceptible to being discriminated against than being black, gay and transgender in a developing country. I certainly don&amp;#39;t intend to invalidate the experience of anyone who has been discriminated against- I also readily accept that compared to a lot of people I&amp;#39;ve lived a very privileged life myself. And i also readily accept that there is a lot more nuance to the subject than (for exemple) being trans or cis, and that discrimination affects people differently based on a variety of factors (for instance the ability to &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; or the like). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I simply don&amp;#39;t understand why so much of the debate in LGBT+ communities or racial minorities consists of &amp;quot;is X a privilege or not?&amp;quot;. Or rather, it&amp;#39;s mostly &amp;quot;X is a privilege! We need to acknowledge it as such&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think that the term &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot; is problematic is two-fold: first of all, being treated normally shouldn&amp;#39;t be considered a privilege. It makes it sound like basic human decency is something special that some people receive unfairly, when it&amp;#39;s really the opposite (meaning it&amp;#39;s the fact that some people are discriminated against that should be considered abnormal and unfair). Secondly, instead of making people concentrate on the issue at hand (typically racism or homophobia), it makes them concentrate on &amp;quot;exposing&amp;quot; the people that have it better. Which will typically provoke one of 2 reactions from the side characterized as &amp;quot;privileged&amp;quot;: either they will feel guilty for being white/straight, or they will think that the characterization is injust because they also struggle in life and deny being privileged. In either cases this doesn&amp;#39;t help at all the people being discriminated against! The only thing it does is alienating potential allies that feel like they are being guilt-tripped for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you will say &amp;quot;yes but the fact that some people have an advantage should be acknowledged by society&amp;quot; well yes, of course. But anyone who is smart enough to be worth disussing with already realizes that being white/straight/cis/male is advantageous. And if they don&amp;#39;t, saying &amp;quot;check your privileges&amp;quot; certainly won&amp;#39;t change that, quite the opposite. Maybe this just comes down to my personal experience, but in my case almost every single person that has ever physically harassed or bullied/insulted me in my adult life belonged to a very specific group (male, religious, low education). These are people that are also discriminated against for other reasons, and having a meaningful discussion with them isn&amp;#39;t even in the realm of possibility. What needs to be done is have better education, i really don&amp;#39;t see how accusing people of being &amp;quot;privileged&amp;quot; achieves anything as far as actual racism/homophobia is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly it seems to me that the reason this is a thing is that instead of working towards making an actual change, a lot of people nowadays are reveling in their status of &amp;quot;discriminated against&amp;quot; and base their identity around it.&lt;/p&gt;

However when we are talking about cleanliness I would argue there&amp;#39;s no comparison. Showers evenly distribute water over your body while efficiently mixing with soap to break apart oils, dirt, and sweat that are stuck to your skin. Plus in a bath you&amp;#39;re kind of left to sit in the water that&amp;#39;s now mixed with all the grime that comes off your body, as opposed to the dirty water being sucked down the drain when you&amp;#39;re in the shower. Again, I&amp;#39;m not bashing baths here, just saying when the priority is to get yourself clean, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s even close.&lt;/p&gt;

White supremacy is an example of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is currently progressive/Leftist tendency to say that we must think of ourselves not as Irish, Polish, Greek, Nigerian, Jamaican, Dominican Americans but as “white” and “Black” first, and essentially view ourselves as homogenous groups whose differences aren’t relevant because those differences have no bearing on the experience of privilege or oppression within the group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS IS VERY TOXIC especially for white people because the second that collectivism around whiteness becomes commonplace, it is a breeding ground for white supremacy. Forcing unity of identity between groups of people with little in common other than complexion creates collective white identity which has never historically led to anything positive for race relations. It is far better for instance that white people do not view themselves as a cohesive group but as Irish, Polish, Greek, Italian etc who share little more other than skin color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, grouping all Black people together is also nonsensical because the cultural differences that exist between an Ethiopian, Nigerian, Dominican, African American and Jamaican are very present as are their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

Dispensation is a very real thing and even then, fully joining takes years (I know someone who just got her final vows and she started in 2007). There are dozens of women&amp;#39;s orders and many of them don&amp;#39;t even wear the habit or wimple anymore. There is no deep symbolism to the outfit itself - it&amp;#39;s just what women wore back in the Middle Ages; some orders changed the uniform, others did not. I know nuns who wear the full ensemble and I know nuns who wear normal clothes - neither sees the other as being any lesser for their different apparel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hijab is directly mandated by the hadiths (if you are a Quranist, it&amp;#39;s more open to interpretation), which make it clear that women who do not observe it are sinning. The whole modesty thing is a modern excuse - it came along because Umar (2nd Rashidun caliph) was complaining about Sawdah (Muhammad&amp;#39;s wife between Khadija and Aisha) arousing him, and this was the compromise instead of women being under house arrest. The most conservative views say the hijab is much more than a headscarf - even a woman&amp;#39;s voice or something as simple as a handshake are considered part of her nakedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen any Catholics threatening random women on social media with hellfire for not wearing a mantilla, but i&amp;#39;ve seen lots of victim blaming with Muslim women who aren&amp;#39;t dong it &amp;quot;properly.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m sure there are Muslim women who wear it of their own volition, but at the same time, I am sure there are plenty who don&amp;#39;t and aren&amp;#39;t saying anything because of social/religious pressure. Lastly, you cannot tell me that small children who wear the hijab are giving their consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: A nun&amp;#39;s habit isn&amp;#39;t so much a religious garb as it is a uniform for a career choice. The hijab is very much connected with a subconscious desire to censor women and sexualize them.&lt;/p&gt;

She moved to another country and went to the doctor. Although the woman didn&amp;#39;t show any related symptoms, the doctor requested her do an HIV test &amp;quot;because she is from Africa&amp;quot;. The patient sees this as racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research and found that in South Africa 20% of the adult population has HIV. And a large share of them does not even know they are HIV positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical authorities from all over the world recommend practitioners to HIV test patients that have some non-negligible risk of having HIV, however small that risk is. That includes victims of rape, people who have unprotected casual sex, sex workers, gay men, among other groups considered at risk. Even among these groups, rates of undetected HIV are below what is seen in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I believe it is the doctor&amp;#39;s duty to explain in a clear and respectful way why they are requesting an HIV exam, to make it as safe and confortable an experience as possible to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got banned from a subreddit for pointing out that requesting an HIV test from a patient from south africa is not necessarily racist. It is good practice, with few exceptions. I believe what made this woman feel uncomfortable about the HIV test is her own prejudice against HIV patients and ignorance of the statistics. HIV testing is quick, simple, and nothing to be offended by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my point is: the doctor must be respectful and offer information, but patients should be submitted to simple exams if they are part of certain demographics according to statistical data, and they are wrong to claim that is racism/discrimination/etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would argue that there&amp;#39;s a difference between petty shoplifting (snatching toothpaste from CVS) and mobs armed with sledgehammers destroying property. For employees, it&amp;#39;s distressing to see armed mobs destroying their workplace, especially because they don&amp;#39;t know that the armed mob won&amp;#39;t hurt them. And people have gotten hurt before during these smash and grabs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the executives and CEOs of these major companies are far away from the crimes being committed, so if this is supposed to be retaliation against them for mistreating employees (or if people think what is happening is OK because of past wrongdoing, it&amp;#39;s very misguided seeing as employees are the ones getting hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why so many people are jumping to the defense of the criminals vandalizing stores, so maybe I can find out how somebody who is defending them views the situation and, possibly, change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Real communism may have not ever been achieved, but it has certainly been &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt;, and to ignore that ignores the real and tangible contributions of real people to the theory and practice of socialism. Mao, Lenin, Castro and Stalin all read and wrote extensively about Marxist theory and made many justifications on how their policies would bring their respective countries closer to the ideal of Marx. If you would want to establish real communism, you have to see how past people did it and what they got right and wrong. And it&amp;#39;s not as if they were all charlatans either who only cared about money or big mansions - that kind of thinking leads to small men who get overthrown easily. A lot of these people genuinely bought into their own bullshit and believed that communism would be achieved within their lifetimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a self-fulfilling redundancy where you essentially define your ideology as being perfect, and any attempt to do it where it goes wrong can be easily disavowed because if it were truly attempted, it would obviously succeed. Communism may be an ideal, but it is also inherently flawed because of the means available to us to achieve that ideal in the first place, no?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of innocent people will never be non zero, and, coupled with other reasons such as the fact it is more expensive than life in prison, to have the DP in society is inappropriate; no one should be at the risk of death due to a flawed system.&lt;/p&gt;

CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Washington Post, New York Times are all missing.  There are also some local smaller outlets reporting on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should really wake people up about what these media outlets are all about.  When the Kyle Rittenhouse shootings happened, all of the media outlets I named were reporting on those shootings non-stop for weeks.  There were many stories published as well as many opinion pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s eerily quiet about an event that even objectively, just based on the number of victims is much bigger (6 killed and dozens wounded vs 2 killed and 1  wounded).  Not to mention that in this case the dead and injured include kids and women.  Also not even mentioning that this did not happen during a riot/protest, but was done at a peaceful parade.  Also done by a man with a violent criminal record who was out on bail at the time of the incident compared to Kyle with no criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at the MSNBC Daily today, 2 out of the first eleven stories they have are about Rittenhouse (they are still talking about Rittenhouse), there is stuff about white supremacy, trans deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main story seems to be about Arbery and there is something about Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that even mentions Darrell Brooks or Waukesha.  CNN is similar, there is nothing on their main news pages about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly evidence of media bias because this IS a big story, one that is objectively bigger that the Rittenhouse story at the time it happened (based on number and age of victims alone) and yet there is a lack of coverage of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

Work just takes away from stuff I would rather be doing and honestly it depresses me and angers me so much that even during my off time I often don&amp;#39;t end up doing what I want to do because I&amp;#39;m so pissed that I had to work and dread going back to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is how it goes on any sub not devoted to humor or neutral topics (i.e. without any political, social or psychological relevance whatsoever)... you have two choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) Choose to post something short and blunt, get a torrent of people spamming the same exact objection, which you do have a response to but you have to repeat it over and over until your fingers bleed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) Choose to post something of medium to long length, everyone reads 10% of it and skims the rest, and then spews out &lt;strong&gt;the same exact frickin&amp;#39; objections anyway&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is allowed because being lazy or an illiterate moron is not just &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt;, but is actively &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt; by mods on those types of subs... because this level of idiocy is very time-efficient, drives sub activity, and drives the drama that ultimately gives them that sweet, sweet release of dopamine that they so crave when they get to remove a post (generally for the crime of being too coherent and/or too non-troll-y.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no option C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is ever warned, banned or otherwise sanctioned for posting non-sequiturs, straw men, or generally incoherent second grade level drivel. Ever. On any sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on top of this, the overwhelming majority of mods also lazy and/or capricious (see above comment re: dopamine) and/or pursuing their own agenda, so it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what the rules are anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also the matter of CONSTANTLY having to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that you&amp;#39;re not a conservative (and I most certainly am not!) in order to make any comment that in any way that &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; contradicts the moronically fortune cookie-level party line that the popular left happens to be championing today.  E.g. Fauci is a self-serving asshat who obviously made the pandemic much worse, but no one can mention this without prefacing it with a 10,000 word essay about how horrible Trump and Rand Paul are.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet actually taking the time to post those sorts of disclaimers is enough to make your post too long for 95% of people to bother reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, any time you comprehensively and decisively debunk someone&amp;#39;s ignorant nonsense with a bevy of citations and earnest rhetoric, there will be no reply (unless it&amp;#39;s someone who simply ignores what you wrote and starts strawmanning), but instead there will be a single and amusingly defiant vote down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) there&amp;#39;s no penalty for doing this (because everyone copied Slashdot&amp;#39;s amazing idea of comment moderation, but no one bothered copying or expanding on the equally important concept of meta-moderation to keep it honest) and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) your intelligent rebuttal is far, far too long for anyone other than the poster you&amp;#39;re replying to to bother reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And due to a combination of the above reasons, Hot / Top are inevitably dominated by the same asinine line-toeing topics, so you have to wade through the garbage heap of New in order to find something that isn&amp;#39;t the same cliched circlejerk you&amp;#39;ve seen 1000 times before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is section is NOT meant to be a part of my CMV (otherwise, a particularly intrepid mod might claim it runs afoul of rule D!) I am including this here ONLY for the sake of mods who may be considering removing the post, and for those considering reporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule A: I clearly pass this rule, though I&amp;#39;m sure an especially ambitious mod could simply claim that I posted less than 500 words (in base 200!), in which case I&amp;#39;ll simply have to tip my hat to their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule B &amp;quot;willingness&amp;quot;: It would be very, very, very easy to change my view. &lt;strong&gt;Link to a sub where the clowns and trolls are not running the show.&lt;/strong&gt;  That would change my mind. It&amp;#39;s exceedingly simple.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it doesn&amp;#39;t actually matter if I do end up posting 7 times that my view has &amp;#39;substantially changed&amp;#39;, because someone only has to link 3 posts where I disagreed with examples provided (by trolls and/or the illiterate) and that will surely be enough to have the post removed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule B &amp;quot;soapbox&amp;quot;: Lol, hell no I don&amp;#39;t expect to any of this change anyone&amp;#39;s mind. I&amp;#39;ve spent a few hours going through this sub and it&amp;#39;s obviously beyond redemption. The vast majority of people here (as elsewhere on Reddit! No rule D, no rule D! This isn&amp;#39;t meta! I mention it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to explain why I certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t bother trying to soapbox here) are lazy douchebags, and the ones that aren&amp;#39;t certainly don&amp;#39;t need me to explain the patently obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BUT! Some noble person from this remaining tiny percentage might be able to give me a counterexample, thus Changing My View and giving me a more worthwhile sub to focus on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, because I almost always make the effort to articulate myself clearly and completely, this will likely be deemed &amp;quot;soapboxing&amp;quot; by mods who are used to people posting the textual equivalent of a stream of emojis.&lt;/strong&gt;  The working definition of &amp;quot;non-soapboxing&amp;quot; is obviously just flinging your feces at a wall for a couple minutes and calling it a post.  Whereas anyone who actually thinks about things and has ideas complex enough to rise above a gradeschool level, and is willing to take the time to articulate those ideas, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; has an agenda of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(But not the legions of trolls; those guys are cool.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule C: I think my title more or less covers it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule D &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;: Again, I&amp;#39;m more than happy to not mention this subreddit at all (and indeed this entire section is meant ONLY for the mods.) HOWEVER, what may end up happening is this: some troll is going to go through my post history and comment on something specific. I will inevitably respond, because I have no self-restraint whatsoever in these matters. This will be used as justification to remove the post, while the troll (who brought up the subbreddit first) will suffer no consequences. C&amp;#39;est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again this isn&amp;#39;t specific to this sub. The mods on nonhumorous/noninformational subs know well enough not to remove the trolls.  Trolls are their lifeblood.  Without the trolls and the circlejerkers, who would drive their traffic up to desirable levels (as well as luring in unsuspecting victims to be sacrificed for that sublime hit of dopamine)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule D &amp;quot;personal harm&amp;quot;: I mean, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true that 97% of Reddit (and the human race in general) would serve society infinitely better by being fed into a wood chipper and used as fertilizer for crops. This is just an objective fact. You can&amp;#39;t argue with facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, I&amp;#39;m not campaigning for this nor do I bear especially ill will toward any one &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule D &amp;quot;self-promotion&amp;quot;:  Uh. no. I mean Christ, if anyone has a good idea for actually monetizing my entirely well-founded and righteous contempt, PLEASE DM me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule E: Oh, believe you me I will respond. And it will not be low effort.  I can count on one hand the number of Reddit users I&amp;#39;ve ever seen who&amp;#39;ve put more effort into their responses than I (on any sub. I&amp;#39;m NOT talking about this sub! No Rule D violation!)&lt;/p&gt;

This would somewhat exclude young children, infants, and animals which is why we do certain things without their consent, and I&amp;#39;m not going to defend that parties with limited rationality have a right to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, the right to bodily autonomy would include a right to end one&amp;#39;s life on their own terms because that is just a person exercising control over their body, and it doesn&amp;#39;t violate the rights of anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, a lot of suicides can be irrational. But I don&amp;#39;t think suicide is ever immoral, unless perhaps if someone&amp;#39;s dependant on you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential objections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanting to die is a sign of mental illness, and thus irrationality. So no one has the right to die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it irrational to want to die though? It is true that humans on average will value their own lives, but I don&amp;#39;t think it follows from this that they therefore ought to value their own lives. Why is it always in one&amp;#39;s self-interest to live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have a right to someone&amp;#39;s labor, so you don&amp;#39;t have a right to something like euthanasia or assisted suicide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t disagree with this, however, I still think people should at least have the option to go see a doctor for the chance of receiving assisted suicide. People still have a right to at least associate themselves in consensual relationships where they get a say, so why can&amp;#39;t a doctor and a patient engage in such a consensual relation? I don&amp;#39;t think doctors should be fired for refusing to deliver a certain type of care, but this is still compatible with saying that the state should lift certain restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who genuinely want to die will find ways to die without assisted suicide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if completely remember the objection correctly, but I&amp;#39;ll respond to this statement anyways. Yes, people may end up finding other ways to die if they&amp;#39;re desparate, but I don&amp;#39;t see how it follows that we need to maintain a restriction on something like assisted suicide. People still have a right to engage in certain consensual relations. They should have certain positive freedoms. Why would we need to limit their options? Now if the point of this objection is trying to say that it&amp;#39;s useless to lift the restriction because people will just use other methods of killing themselves instead, then this arguably seems false. People will no longer have to use certain methods which are less successful or have a higher risk for leaving them disabled, and they also have an incentive to not commit suicide in public areas which will traumitize more people. Granted, in an assisted suicide scenario, you&amp;#39;re probably still affecting the doctor mentally, but you&amp;#39;re still traumitizing less people in that setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the uselessness of lifting a regulation which infringes on bodily autonomy doesn&amp;#39;t thereby follow that we shouldn&amp;#39;t life that regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the right to die will lead to more irrational suicides and will lead to abuse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think certain policies could be enacted to prevent irrational suicides. For healthy adults who want to kill themselves, there can be a waiting period put in place to give them time to think about whether they actually want to kill themselves. For adults who are chronically or mentally ill, I would rather they don&amp;#39;t have a waiting period if they are in lots of suffering and want to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one aspect of society among many that could be pointed to where it is much better for society in general that we have regulation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I saw: A right-leaning 17-year-old boy sees that  left-leaning protests are happening about 20 miles away from him, and  that some of the protestors are being violent and destroying property.  He drives to the scene of the unrest with a semi-automatic rifle, and  begins pointing it at many different people. Many, though not all, of  the people his weapon is pointed at are non-violent and unarmed. People  with weapons point them back at him, they shoot at him, he shoots back,  he kills three people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions on this are divided along political lines, with many  praising his actions as successfully defending someone else&amp;#39;s property.   I personally feel that if this type of behavior is encouraged, it opens  the door for vigilante justice and extrajudicial murder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone owns a business that is at risk during civil unrest, a  third party doesn&amp;#39;t just get to take a deadly weapon, stand in front of  it, and kill anyone they think might pose a risk to that business,  especially when the business owner never asked them to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be used as a justification for nearly any murder, as long  as there&amp;#39;s some sort of identifiable risk nearby. Consider: &amp;quot;A hurricane  passed near our town. There&amp;#39;s a store there that might have been  destroyed (not my store, someone else&amp;#39;s who never asked me to help in  any way). I stood in front of the store to protect it. I brought my  rifle because that&amp;#39;s my right. Someone approached store who I thought  was likely a looter, so I killed them to protect the store.&amp;quot; Basically,  any time there&amp;#39;s unrest, &amp;quot;protecting property&amp;quot; can be used to justify  killing anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rittenhouse was pointing his gun all over the place, which means  that many people could have been justified in feeling that their life  was in danger. If someone shot him in self defense, then his shooting  them back could not be considered self defense either. Even if we don&amp;#39;t  include a legal perspective here, bringing a rifle anywhere and pointing  it at an unarmed person in a vigilante/extrajudicial manner is immoral,  and if people with weapons are pointing them at each other, self  defense no longer becomes a valid moral defense for either of them on  the whole. Once someone starts shooting at Rittenhouse, his only viable  choice might have been to shoot back, but that doesn&amp;#39;t discount every  choice he made up until that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I have an incomplete version of the facts, and I&amp;#39;d certainly  love to be corrected (ideally with proper sourcing), but learning more  about that night is only going to change my view if it helps establish  that Rittenhouse was morally justified that night. I really want to see  what I&amp;#39;m missing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, gerrymandering allows a party (both Democrats and Republicans do this) to essentially determine election results ahead of time. There is no way this is healthy for a democracy like the US. Democracy is supposed to be free and fair, and deciding results ahead of time or altering maps to benefit yourself is definitely not fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the issue of an increasing willingness from the Republicans to reject all defeats as fraudulent (I personally find this hypocritical given their record of passing voter restriction laws). You might know that this is one of the things that put the US on the receding democracies list earlier this year. This wouldn’t concern me too much if it was just talk, but an increasing amount of “election fraud” lawyers are being appointed to election boards, which will probably allow them to overturn any defeats by refusing to certify the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these are my two top concerns with US democracy, especially the second one. I guess this is why the US is a “flawed democracy” and not a full democracy like many other countries and why it is classified as a receding democracy this year. I know that I’m wrong about a couple of things, so feel free to point out my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not talking about 200 lb people, but people who are 300+ lbs believing they are healthy and that there’s nothing wrong with them, the media encouraging them too. Those people will probably need oxygen, are taking a plethora of medications, probably can’t walk for more than 5 minutes, and can barely move. Not to mention the psychological toll it has to be taking on them. Shows like my 600 and 1000lb life disgust me. They show women who clearly need serious help and somehow glorify their life. Sure, they have docs on the show but you see how they don’t take them seriously. Those people are disgusting. No, people who mention their health are not being fatphobic, those are genuine concerns. If you don’t want to change your life, so be it. But don’t showcase your death wish for others to see. Stop glorifying it. It’s not cute, it’s not trendy, no one should want to look like that.

&lt;p&gt;This is based on the assumption that you have the ability to spend your money somewhere else, which I think is true much more often than not. After all, most things aren’t strictly necessary to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

I will agree, making incels mad is quite funny. However, telling them to get laid will not stop them from hating women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of incels goes far deeper than the inability to have sex. It usually stems from popular culture (specifically from the 1980s-2010s), portraying those who don&amp;#39;t have a lot of sex or those who look like the average person, as losers. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean incels are free from blame, it should be their responsibility to distinguish reality from fantasy. However, that fantasy can leave an impression on the youth, specifically those in high school. Mind you, incels don&amp;#39;t just wake up and start hating women one day, its a slow process, taking months or even years to fully mature the hatred. It&amp;#39;s a process that usually starts in high school, where everyone is trying to make a name for themselves in those 4 short years. If anyone here has been to high school, you should know how the social hierarchy works in that hell hole. Though its not as common anymore (thank fuck), virgins still get made fun of and are considered losers who are ultimately at the bottom of this hierarchy. Now think about it, you have an insecure person who grew up with this sort of culture all their lives, then they go to high school (specifically between the late 1990s and early to mid 2010s), which then reinforces this way of thinking with the established hierarchy, you now have the perfect breeding ground for incels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just add one more thing. Porn. As we all know, most porn is fake as fuck and as teenagers, its safe to say that 80% of us has watched porn at least once in our lives. When we watch porn, we see this fake image of what sex is supposed to be. Y&amp;#39;know loud, easy, good looking models, large dicks, large breasts, etc. Essentially people that some people consider &amp;quot;flawless&amp;quot;. But behind the scenes, its just fake as fuck. However, incels more or less don&amp;#39;t know this, and consider those &amp;quot;flawless&amp;quot; individuals as &amp;quot;Chads/Tyrones&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stacies&amp;quot;. To them, those &amp;quot;Chads&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stacies&amp;quot; are the ones who are valued more in society, because of the supposed ease they have getting sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, telling incels to get laid is a horrible thing to do. It only reinforces the idea of &amp;quot;The amount of sex a person has is equal to an individual&amp;#39;s value in society and if I don&amp;#39;t have sex, I am worthless.&amp;quot; Sex is not the equivalent of therapy. So stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Telling an incel to get laid is bad. It only reinforces the idea of &amp;quot;sex = individual value.&amp;quot; Inceldom stems from years of unchecked insecurities and horrible pop culture. They need therapy not sex.&lt;/p&gt;

My local news will give a description of white people no problem even when it doesn’t necessarily matter. But when it’s a minority group it’s extra vague. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there was a story about a woman who was harassing some kids to get off the sidewalk riding bikes and spit on them. She was arrested and taken to jail, they had her name and age but for some reason had to make it known she was white. It wasn’t really relevant &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there was a story about a group of 3 “massage therapist” who were meeting people at hotels and robbing them. the clients who came forward gave a description but the news only reported “3 women about 5’10”-6ft tall posing as masseuses”. This spree went on for another week until they were finally caught and it turned out to be 3 black transwomen. The people who came forward said they gave this information &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another kinda goofy one was where the guy was caught on camera robbing a store and they described everything about him, down to a bandage on his leg, excluding his race. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how it’s pretty easy to tell when some crime was committed by a nonwhite person because there’s no mention of race at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this In itself is bigoted and dangerous. I don’t know how effective descriptions actually are, but I’d bet they’re far less effective leaving out major descriptions like this as well. Just put relevant descriptions in all articles or none&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many extremely prominent individuals and organizations have made it clear that much like their (usually right-wing) opponents, they do not care about accused individuals who do not line up with their politics or aren the wrong race. Similar to free speech, the concept of criminal justice needs to be politically agnostic. There should be no political prosecutions in this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/19/statement-by-president-biden/&quot;&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-kamala-harris-denounces-rittenhouse-verdict-says-clearly-theres-a-lot-more-work-to-do/&quot;&gt;VP&lt;/a&gt;,  to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1461762952567136259&quot;&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; of all places, prominent people who say they are proponents of Criminal Justice Reform have not only spouted misinformation about the facts of the case, but have objected to a decision made by a jury of fellow citizens, an extremely dangerous president to set. They&amp;#39;ve made it clear that they would have preferred Rittenhouse be found guilty of murder without any real explanation of their stance outside of objecting with how it made them feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in no way condoning the valorization of Rittenhouse by the right, but the left has been entirely unprincipled in this extremely important area of governance and their hypocrisy has hurt the overall cause. &lt;strong&gt;If you&amp;#39;re unwilling to support people you do no like, you don&amp;#39;t actually care about a principle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since children can&amp;#39;t hold jobs, no amount of hard work or personal responsibility is going to help them pay for medical care. Since their parents make the vast majority of nurturing decisions for them (like what to eat and what to drink) their medical issues are very unlikely to be their fault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children aren&amp;#39;t their parents&amp;#39; property. A system in which a child receives inadequate medical care because his parents&amp;#39; are janitors with bad health insurance is an immoral system.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t watch live news, I don’t watch streams, I tend to, in general, steer clear of this kind of stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only real understanding of what was going on with the Rittenhouse case was the few threads I read on here and a couple clips I saw/heard from other peoples devices when I was present, other than the basics of what happened from back when it all actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as much as I tried to stay neutral, I formulated an opinion, though not a particularly firm one, admittedly. My initial opinion was that he was an absolute idiot for going to Kenosha to begin with armed with a gun, and was probably looking for trouble, and had no reason to go there as he didn’t even live in Wisconsin. And while he may have actually feared for his life in that moment, he probably should be found guilty because of his stupid decisions that lead him to be in that position in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But curiosity and a desire for the truth got the best of me, and I went and watched archives of the full trial. And boy did angry people angry at the acquittal and the media misrepresent realty in a &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; way. But the most concerning issue here is that I actually think that many of the angry people on social media that want Rittenhouse in prison &lt;em&gt;aren’t even aware of how incredibly misinformed they are.&lt;/em&gt; Because all they’ve seen is what CNN or their favorite social media reporter/influencer wants them to see, which paints a picture very different from reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They never mention that Rittenhouse had family and friends that live in Kenosha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They never mention that he was employed in Kenosha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To both of these points, they make it seem like he’s over there blindly and had no reason to be there other than to be in the fray and incite fear and hostility in rioters. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They never show pictures of him the previous day scrubbing graffiti off the walls of the high school down the road from where the shooting took place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They never show footage of him walking around with his medical bag asking people if they need medical assistance, yelling “friendly friendly friendly” to assure everyone that he’s not hostile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And most importantly, they never show any of the footage that clearly shows from multiple angles all three of the people he shot, and the fact that he was running away from 2 of them, lunged at by one before cornered between vehicles and a mob of people while his weapon was being grabbed, and the other two he was hit in the head and knocked down while being advanced on by a mob of people. He was sitting down flat on his ass while a man charged him and pointed a gun point blank at his head, and Kyle gave him a chance to retreat. And did not shoot numerous other people, who did retreat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clear, implicit bias by left wing media by intentionally omitting information they most certainly had access to. I can only assume this was done with the intent of riling up the American public for profit, and quite potentially in hopes of stirring more civil unrest and riots in the wake of whatever outcome was to come of this highly charged and politicized trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely disgusting, and an egregious misuse of the public ear.&lt;/p&gt;

Nuclear energy has unfortunately suffered some pretty large PR disasters in the past (Chernobyl, Fukushima etc) and this has understandably shaken public trust in its safety. Despite its bad rep, nuclear energy has consistently been shown to be orders of magnitude safer than most other methods of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chernobyl had too much red tape. Fukushima was built on a fault line. The third was almost a disaster. Need I say more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh&quot;&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt; have shown that nuclear energy causes just 0.07 deaths for every tera-watt hour of electricity generated. This is in comparison with 2.82 for gas, 18.43 for oil and 32.72 for coal. Nuclear power plants do not release any carbon dioxide during the course of energy generation and even accounting for CO2 emissions during construction, the emissions associated with nuclear energy are still 50 times lower than those associated with coal power and 30 times lower than those associated with coal mining and natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One often overlooked aspect of the pollution released by coal power is that ash released from burning coal often contains highly concentrated levels of thorium and urainium. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/&quot;&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt; have shown that exposure to the elevated levels of radioactive material present in coal ash has the result that people living in the vicinity of coal power stations experience radiation doses up to 200% greater than those living close by to nuclear power plants. Bizarrely enough, the radioactive waste produced by burning coal is actually more radioactive than the waste from nuclear power and yet there are no restrictions on coal ash simply being released into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is a low carbon, low risk method of energy generation and has an essential part to play in the battle against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydro and Wind can&amp;#39;t run entire countries without a really large supply of either. At best, they simply lower costs overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as neither request nor refusal results in or calls for physical harm to either party, both are strictly matters of social contract, and fall outside the purview of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal interpretation: a reasonable person should try their best to accommodate such a request (and broadcasting such a request via LinkedIn profile or email signature is useful guidance to avoid hurting each other&amp;#39;s feelings), but if they forget or slip up, that can&amp;#39;t be illegal. At the same time, if someone refuses such a request, that is their right, but they should accept the consequences of being perceived as bigoted and/or derogatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray area: explicit refusal to use requested pronouns in such a way as to intentionally cause psychological harm. To me this is hate speech, which although constitutionally legal, should carry heavy social stigma (similar to using a racial slur).&lt;/p&gt;

She’s started telling me things like “did you know women aren’t provided any kind of pain medication after giving birth?”. That just sounds ridiculous, so I asked her where she learned it from. I told her any doctor that is making Tik Tok videos should always be questioned. I related it to celebrity doctors like Dr. Oz. Who in my eyes aren’t trusty worthy. Also a quick google search found that U of M study, conducted by Dr. Alex Friedman Peahle, M.D., focused on women with private health insurance across America and found that among those who had a C-section, 76% would be prescribed an opioid. For vaginal l births, the figure was 27%.&lt;/p&gt;
