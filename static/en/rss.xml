And that’s saying a lot since many consider COVID’s health risks to be negligible even before a vaccine existed. Since May, 99% of COVID deaths were unvaccinated people. Most of the unvaccinated are that way by choice, not medical necessity. We are at the point where anyone who wants the vaccine can get it.&lt;br/&gt;
I did my part. I wore my mask, practiced social distancing, and got my vaccine as soon as I could. I don’t have a problem with the unvaccinated choosing to have a 100x higher risk of dying to COVID but I should not bear any burden of mitigating that risk for them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit] since so many are bringing up immunocompromised people: We were never expected to mask up to protect them from any viruses prior to COVID. Since COVID may not be eradicated with a vaccine, this is essentially an argument for wearing masks forever, since there will always be immunocompromised people. No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (20M) have been raised alongside the internet and got involved in social media pretty early on 12/13 - this is the case for many younger people - and I can&amp;#39;t help noticing how we&amp;#39;re creating more and more labels to put people in boxes as racist, homophobic, 
... e.g. the term &amp;quot;microaggression&amp;quot; that is meant to represent a covert manner of attacking/ostracizing certain groups. As a black man, I&amp;#39;ve had people trying to touch my hair my entire life - I don&amp;#39;t like it, in fact I hate it but is it racist in any way shape or form? No. Is it a microaggression? F*ck no. It&amp;#39;s a person who&amp;#39;s seen something different to what they&amp;#39;re used to (my hair) and was thus curious about how it felt (differently from theirs, surely). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we keep trying to shun people by labeling them with this or that term as soon as they act in a way we perceive as wrong without even giving them the time of day to understand where they&amp;#39;re coming from, we&amp;#39;re going nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve become so heavily politicized that instead of gaining an understanding through experience, we obtain an illusion of that through the skewed views of the people we follow on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ll just say now that I know I am generalizing when I say &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;younger generations&amp;quot;, ... I do understand that not everyone is like this. My point is that social media has seeped through enough of us for this lack of communication to become obvious.)&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m not calling out any specific country, but there are governments that have done mass genocide, invasions, destruction of already functioning democratic governments, killing innocent civilians, deforestation, terrible over pollution, drug smuggling/dealing and much much more all just to turn a profit for themselves.

&lt;p&gt;But I think a lot of non-binary people are just people who want to be special because they decided they don’t want to fit into “traditional gender roles” which is pretty stupid imo &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genderfluidity is dumber. I think this is purely a symptom of the internet. I’m sorry, but there’s no such thing as genderfluidity, it’s called being a human that feels different at different times, and then assigning a term to yourself so that you can be different and special from all the “normies”. If femininity and masculinity defined your gender than we wouldn’t call butch lesbians women, we wouldn’t call twinks men, but we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day it’s not really my business, but then again if you told me any other ridiculous BS I wouldn’t entertain you so 🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often come across posts on social media of people claiming white people can&amp;#39;t experience racism. The argument I come across the most usually goes as follows:  &amp;quot;White people can&amp;#39;t experience racism as they are the oppressor&amp;#39;s, you cant oppress the oppressor&amp;quot;. This is a crappy argument as racism is clearly defended as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because the majority of racism is experienced by POC doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t experience it as someone who is white, this goes for other races as well. Especially on tiktok and twitter I will see people referring to white people as &amp;quot;ranch rodent, mayo monkey, etc..&amp;quot;. This is clearly racism as if I where to refer to someone who is a POC as anything similar to that I would be labeled as a racist. It is also evident when white people are made fun of when expressing that they have been the victim of a race related crime/ incident. I find people will often make fun of them and not take them seriously. Just because it doesn&amp;#39;t happen as often doesn&amp;#39;t take away from the fact that you are being racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming white people can&amp;#39;t experience racism is an incredibly flawed argument. Again I&amp;#39;m not trying to invalidate anyone, but it sets an unhealthy double standard.&lt;/p&gt;

To be clear, this isn&amp;#39;t a pro-slurs freeze peach CMV, I&amp;#39;m more just a little puzzled by what is easily the most common reaction to a slur being referenced.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a massive degree of reverence that is given to slurs. A recent situation occurred in my (very politically inclined, and part of an extended discussion on the subject) friend group. I was talking about the racist origins of the southern strategy and while quoting Lee Atwood, the inventor of the racist southern strategy, quoted the n word.
  &amp;quot;By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused a brouhaha which I apologised for, despite being a bit puzzled. Everybody present was white. The context was in an explicit condemnation of racism, and was a quote of an individual who I was rather heatedly criticising at the time. It&amp;#39;s such an abstract rule to enforce in this context. Nobody can actually explain why they&amp;#39;re offended by it, but we&amp;#39;ve become so socially conditioned against the word, just a mere academic reference to it is enough to make us flinch. This is insane.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I understand that flippant use of slurs is bad. It&amp;#39;s bad because it harms people through the normalisation of racism. But somewhere along the way refusal to refer to slurs has become a weird irreducible deontological principle that nobody seems to be able to explain. I&amp;#39;m not suggesting we bring back the n word into common conversation, but surely just &lt;em&gt;referring&lt;/em&gt; to the word shouldn&amp;#39;t be offensive if there&amp;#39;s no racism or risk of normalisation being carried along with it implicitly. Racism is disgusting and isn&amp;#39;t just hurt feelings. It&amp;#39;s extremely damaging and its influences are incredibly deeply seated in people&amp;#39;s minds that an attack on racism is seen as an attack on a country itself.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we ban certain speech, usually I understand it as a method of mitigating some kind of harm. Shouting fire in a crowded theatre. Inciting violence. Needless verbal abuse. Abuse on the basis of a protected class. I get it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not tolerating the &lt;em&gt;word itself&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not upset, I&amp;#39;m just... confused. I just do not understand it. Not even a rhetorical lack of understanding, I&amp;#39;m genuinely puzzled why people think this way. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a good reason that&amp;#39;s blindingly obvious that I am missing. Please, change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

When I do have to go back to live TV for whatever reason, the ad breaks are so disruptive.  Not just taking the time away from the show, but commercials have different volume levels, different art styles, different everything! From the other commercials as well as the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: I’d way rather have a moment in a show where the main character has a 30 second car ride up a long driveway to walk up to the front door of a secondary character. Basically a car commercial with a bunch of glamour shots of a shiny car with a handsome driver. At least the sound design, and the direction, would fit with the rest of the show. Main character knocks on the door and we hit the ground running with the episode. Maybe they go inside and there are Heinekens on the table. Who cares? We’re in the universe of the show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that would change my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a strong financial argument that product placement things simply aren’t lucrative enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a slippery slope type argument that the line between art and commercialism would be blurred even further to the point of being indistinguishable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a full throated defense of commercials I guess? I’m not taking this so seriously, whatever ya got!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR is getting paid to go through this slog. Job applicants are not. It takes a long time to tailor resumes and cover letters to however many dozens of listings for however many companies to which you apply, whereas it&amp;#39;s literally the job of somebody in a position to hire to know what a given opening requires and who will be a good fit for their organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Japan, there&amp;#39;s a standard resume format that everyone uses in which you list all of your academic and professional experience - and there is far less emphasis on the cover letter. It seems to work fine,  so how can it be the case that the &amp;quot;tailoring&amp;quot; expectation is anything other than an attempt to shift paid workload onto people who probably won&amp;#39;t even get a response about the job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this argument seems nonsensical. How can requiring wearing a mask and getting a vaccine a form of government control? What does the US government possibly gain by giving away free vaccines and requiring people to wear masks to stop the spread of the virus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the government should be worried about masks, as it interferes with face recognition technology and makes catching criminals harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would mask mandates be all about controlling the American public when it’s actually counter protective to catching criminals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for vaccines, why would giving away vaccines be a form of government control? The government gains nothing and instead giving something away for free is actually a financial loss on those distributing the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does free mRNA technology in your body possibly do to you that you’re now suddenly susceptible to government control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it weird that people who are anti mask and anti vaxx say this is government control and yet, they are still allowed to criticize vaccine and mask mandates and half the country’s politicians and citizens agree. That doesn’t sound like government control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our government needs people who do not believe in themselves so they can do these menial jobs and not find out they are being exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe a solution to a lot of our current societal problems can be achieve with a major focus on mental health education and financial literacy for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on each individual on this planet to work on themselves and make it a better place and be more understanding of others differences and faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s either because the internet has existed for the past 30 years and information is allowed to flow freely and word about mental health can get out, or we are actually JUST now making these discoveries in mental health and finding out just how crucial it is. Either way, I feel mental health and financial literacy needs to be educated more to the masses as our next major step towards improving our society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until we are able to work past our own traumas and problems causing us to think the negative ways we do, we will always have these same cycles of problems and will run around in circles for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have changed my view that they did not know what mental health was but I still think we are being hurt by ways that convenience&amp;#39;s Capitalism&amp;#39;s agenda (which leads to a lot of the unknowing mental health issues) and mental health education and financial literacy are what&amp;#39;s needed to combat this.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, before you say &amp;quot;oh its not real&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oh its impossible to tell in anime&amp;quot; let me explain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolicon is pedophilic because its specifically designed after a child, so by specifically looking for it, youre trying to find hentai of children. If you stumble across loli and cant tell its a child from looks and dont know the age, then its fine unless you learn the age because you dont know its a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, yes, it usually is VERY hard to tell in anime, except when its meant to be loli hentai. The problem is being attracted to a minors body or the fact that they are underaged, that is what makes it pedophilia, so if theres a character that looks above 18 but is a minor and you dont know, its fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comss to adults with a petite figure, petite is different in many ways from a childs body, mostly the definition of the torso, arms, legs etc, so it shouldnt be hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

I will try not to take a side on any particular theory, and instead just state the theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conspiracy theory is a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not automatically invalidate the theory. They are simply alternative explanations of events and their causes. One can not invalidate a conspiracy theory without looking at the evidence claimed by the theorists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the moon landing conspiracy. There is a group that believes that humans have never landed on the moon, and that the Apollo 11 landing was filmed on a movie set. Their evidence includes shadow lines in different directions, which are typical of a secondary light source. They also use the video of the flag flapping after being twisted to claim that a flag can’t flap without an atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after examining their evidence, the second shadow can be created by the reflection off of the moon’s surface, and the flapping was from the inertia of the twisting and could be replicated in a vacuum chamber. There is also counter evidence, where Apollo 15 astronauts placed a mirrored reflector in a precise location on the moon, and we can shoot a laser at it from earth and get the laser bounced back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That theory is not inherently invalid because it’s a conspiracy theory, it was proven invalid with evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR you need evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory that also has evidence, change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion was created because humans are inherently afraid of the unknown. We didn’t know where the sun came from and what the stars were so we came up with the most convenient answer: God. God created the sun and stars, along with humans. This answered all of our questions, but now we have science and technology that can answer these questions and when it comes to answering questions, religion should be our very, very last resort. I still believe that religion can be used as a moral backbone for people or as a meaning to life but it should not challenge a concrete theory such as the Big Bang. Scientific theories should be challenged with other theories. I find it ridiculous that there are still christians trying to prove of their gods existence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many people who have a misconception of  native americans being one homogeneous group. This was not the case. War and conflict was not something introduced to the americas by the european. There were many different native american tribes with conflicting ideals and interests that engaged in warfare, and yes, even engaged in slavery, far before european contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very similar mad dash for survival and supremacy which was happening in the lands east of the Atlantic ocean was happening in the lands to the west, before the two had even known of each other, we simply know far more about the former, as those to the east of the Atlantic were far more concerned with the development of written language, the keeping of records, and the survival of those records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lands to the east of the atlantic, as anyone who is aware of history knows, was constantly embroiled in conflict. The difference between this conflict and the conflict in americas, was that these combatants were far more able to benefit from each other, whereas the the americas were cut off from this participation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The players in the domains to the east of the atlantic were able to engage in a sort of hegelian dialectic by bronze, iron and steel. From conflict between Africa, the west, the near east, and the east, between each other and between themselves, they became stronger and more formidable in a feedback loop of being sharpened by conflict and using that sharpening to better engage with those who have also been sharpened by conflict. Not only through warfare, but also through the trade of goods and ideas on the silk road among other avenues, and also especially in contrast to native americans, a much more comprehensive immune system to certain illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through exactly the heat caused by this crucible that the great conquerers east of the Atlantic were forged. A process which those west of the atlantic were cut off from, and thus greatly suffered from when they were introduced to a far more skilled and technologically advanced challenger in their domain from across the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is by mere happenstance that the europeans arrived in america before the great conquerers of the other players east of the atlantic. Every one of these groups had imperialistic and colonialistic factions, though obviously not all of them were equally as successful, and some got complacent. If another one of these groups had made it to the americas first, it is not unlikely we would live in a word where they had been the conquerers of America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has nothing to do with there being any kind of inherent racial differences, any other group in the exact same circumstances would have done the same, as they had already been doing so and attempting to do so throughout history. To believe otherwise &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; to believe in some inherent racial differences between races. It does however have much to do with luck. Luck when it comes to availability of resources and other luck of circumstance, the increasing refinement of the ability to utilize these advantages due to baptism and trial by fire, along with the compounding of these factors over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me use a non-racial analogy: You tripped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I am walking past you sitting down. Our legs make contact and I trip and fall. Let&amp;#39;s look at some possible intents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t see me coming and accidentally tripped me, apologized for the accident, and helped me up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You did see me coming, intended to trip me, laughed as I fell, and did not help me up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw your legs were there, could have slightly altered my path in order not to trip, and tripped over your legs purposefully with the intent to shame you for having your legs in my path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &amp;quot;intent does not matter&amp;quot; logic, all of these scenarios deserve equal treatment. This is obviously wrong to me. Treating someone who does not intend to cause harm as harshly as someone who does is unjust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while this point is ancillary, this &amp;quot;intent does not matter&amp;quot; logic alienates would-be supporters of DEI goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Slavery never went away, it&amp;#39;s a total joke that people care more about inmates labor being exploited when they&amp;#39;re still being treated  humanly under the law compared to the families with children who are smuggled into places like the U.K. and threatened into working for almost nothing but a meal, and are also forced to apply for welfare which is then taken away from them to feed the lavish lifestyle of certain gangs. Criminals and their cults are enduring prison time as it is now a rite of passage for some of them, organizations are ran behind bars, and at times it is prisoners who create dominant criminal organizations. Slaying these modern slave masters on sight should prevent experienced masters from passing their philosophy and experience to their disciples , and demonstrate that slavery isn&amp;#39;t welcomed in modern times. This could be a huge step towards reducing slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

One adult pays the other adult for intimate relations, and they both agree on it. This means one adult has the freedom to spend his/her money however he/she wants, and the other adult has the freedom to use his/her body however he/she wants. Therefore, since both choices aren&amp;#39;t harming anything else in society, it should be legalized. One could argue this negatively affects their &amp;quot;personal lives&amp;quot;, but there is some grey area to that statement. One could also argue drinking alcohol, and gambling(just two examples) negatively affects people&amp;#39;s personal lives, yet, both of them are widely legal beginning at 21 years old, so that argument is invalid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second of all, we already have pornography widely legal in the USA, which is essentially prostitution with an audience. Most porn stars are solely doing porn because they can make quite a bit of money, so isn&amp;#39;t that the same dynamic as prostitution? The only reason I think porn is legal, and not prostitution is because porn helps big business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third of all, one main reason why pornography is illegal is due to it being &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t think laws should be dictated solely on immorality. Murdering someone, raping someone, and stealing from someone else are actions that are widely considered immoral, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;, all three of those actions also grossly harm other people, and/or ends human lives. On the other hand, as I stated before, alcohol, gambling, and even tobacco use can be considered &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot; to some people, yet, all of those are widely legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth of all, there are sexually frustrated people who don&amp;#39;t want to  ruin their lives by risking getting caught seeing a prostitute. It may not sound like much, but it could cause someone to be terminated from their job, and being blacklisted from their careers. With legalized prostitution, this wouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the flawed &amp;quot;immorality&amp;quot; argument, the only consistent argument I see against legalized prostitution is the notion it would increase human trafficking. However, I think that&amp;#39;s speculation more than anything, and we already have a human trafficking problem in the country anyway, so what difference does this make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve definitely had to apologize to people i care about for some things i felt justified doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at my core, i had taken the poisonous victim mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“they did this or did nothing while it happened to me, therefore i can be shitty back”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;victim mentalities lead to people feeling justified doing things they wouldnt let anyone else do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes it sucks when people truly are victims, and they definitely need help. dont get me wrong, if you are a victim of something, get the help you need, dig out of it, do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but dont make that apart of who you are and expect everyone else to owe you for what it is you suffered. thats just self destructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is what most modern day social movements do.
i see a lot of movements enshrining and making sacred the idea that they are the victim at all times, and when they do shitty things, to question them is akin to kicking a wounded puppy, when really they just did something shitty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whether it’s BLM, a religion, LGBT, or Conservatives saying theyre being oppressed or having their rights taken away, doing shitting things to your neighbors says more about you than the people you claim to have been victimized by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also very open to being told I&amp;#39;m an asshole and changing my mind, because this one feels like it could be one of those. An honest effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... Cmon. Your teammates worked their asses off their whole lives, gave it all up for years, to have a shot. And in that they are not all at the pinnacle of the sport, I&amp;#39;d imagine that was the best and maybe only shot for an Olympic gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver is still incredible and I take nothing away from that. I also understand (or more accurately, could never understand) the immense pressure of competing as your team leader on the Olympic stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t you owe it to your teammates to &lt;em&gt;at least try&lt;/em&gt;? You&amp;#39;re allowed to have a bad day, you&amp;#39;re allowed to not be perfect, and silver in that instance would have still been an incredible accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not trying when it matters?&lt;/p&gt;

My friends were talking about this, and there was a consensus between them that their best thoughts come to them in the shower. There&amp;#39;s even a subreddit for these interesting thoughts and revelations that people had while in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lead me to think about what makes the shower so unique compared to the rest of daily life, and what about the shower allows for thoughts to flow freely. From what my friends&amp;#39; said, the shower is a time where they can just think and do nothing else, so it gives them the place to have thoughts that are more interesting than daily life things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me, but if this is the reason for shower thoughts, it also implies that people don&amp;#39;t take the time to think about things outside the shower. Not only that, but people have to shower, so the reason to set this time aside to think about stuff is because you have to in order to be clean. Meaning that just thinking about things is not the first priority while taking a shower and it&amp;#39;s only a byproduct of needing to stay clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since we&amp;#39;ve established that the source for shower thoughts is the fact that the shower is a place where you can just think about whatever, I think this means that if you only have interesting thoughts in the shower, that you&amp;#39;re not taking the time to just think about stuff. Same goes for interesting thoughts before you fall asleep - if that is the only time you can think freely, you&amp;#39;re not investing any time in allowing yourself to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think thinking is so important, and it&amp;#39;s numbing to think only about daily life during the day. If I don&amp;#39;t have enough time to think during the day I have a hard time falling asleep, since that&amp;#39;s the only other time I have if I can&amp;#39;t find the time during the day. How are you supposed to lead your life if the only time you get to think is your 15 minute shower?&lt;/p&gt;

Without these kinds of scandals showing up all the time in the news, I think people would be more trusting of the medical industry as a whole, and there would be less anti-vax sentiment.

&lt;p&gt;This academic attitude of being willing and often even eager to &amp;quot;throw away&amp;quot; the way we traditionally did things and thought about stuff if there&amp;#39;s new evidence makes it really hard for the right to really embrace science- and evidence-based policies.

Using examples such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters, but while these were tragic, this doesn’t represents nuclear safety and the benefits that nuclear power has as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;75% of Frances energy comes from nuclear power plants and a lot of Sweden’s power is the same, I don’t know much about European power plants, but I haven’t heard much of any accidents occurring in these areas, at least nowhere near the level of others. And while climate activist have sort of stopped nuclear power plants from being built in European countries it hasn’t stopped other countries from mass producing them, a example would be China that puts a new one on the grid every two to three months, supplying its citizens with plenty of energy, and it’s the same in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do we see nuclear power as so dangerous, this is most likely caused by the mentioned nuclear disasters I said earlier. Fukushima while definitely a disaster, acutely didn’t reach dangerous radiation levels. While there definitely was a spike in radiation, it was actually all under the regular safety limit for most nuclear power plants. It was sadly due to mass panic that led to many deaths that occurred not too long after, helping to bring up suicide and depression rates in that time period during the mass evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chernobyl is another example of a terrible tragedy, and while this is definitely A terrible event with mass radiation everywhere way above the lethal limit in some areas. This was all caused by cutting corners or poor maintenance. The reason the plant cut corners was too please soviet dictators of the time as this was a part of Soviet Russia and we all know their standards were really low. But since the Soviet Union disbanded, The Russian government has tried their best to lower the radiation limits, and in fact you can now stand right outside the big dome that was put over top of the plant, and you will not be susceptible to lethal amounts of radiation. No nuclear reactor today will be built like Chernobyl, it will have some of the highest safety regulations that any can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you include all the deaths from major nuclear power disasters, It comes nowhere near the amount of deaths in other power fields such as Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas. It’s even almost as safe as wind and solar in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why people don’t like nuclear power is the waste that is generated from it. But even if you collected all the nuclear waste from just America’s power plants for 60 years straight, The waste that would be generated would only fill The size of an average Walmart, which is somewhat big, but it is pretty easy to get rid of. Bury it hundreds of miles into the earth, or even just shoot it off into space with a few rockets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is another thing that’s actually good about nuclear energy, it’s just as cheap as wind and solar, making it good for costs, and it also helps to manufacture them a lot easier. Though right now with Americans regulations, we can only build a nuclear power plant every 12 to 15 years and it can take up 6 to 7 years just to get permission to start building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nuclear power can definitely be dangerous in the wrong circumstances, it is a better alternative to other forms of energy, based on its safety, Energy efficiency, and Low costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently someone at some point decided that the mouth is not a part of the human body (?). I am having a problem in my jaw that causes pain, will only get worse, and has to be fixed with dental care. It is not related to hygiene and there is nothing I could have done to prevent it. I am pissed that I am spending so much money with this. If it was a problem anywhere else in my body, I would have it covered by the universal healthcare system I have access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone please try to convince me that it is a good idea to not include dental care in the system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few points that I wanna argue preemptively before anyone tries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is expensive, not even healthcare should be universal!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no thanks to the american dystopia. I love the healthcare system I have access to, and I want it to be even bigger. I don&amp;#39;t advocate only for myself, but also for poorer people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;People will become careless with their teeth!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe that. Obesity rates in America prove otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A lot of dental treatment is unnecessary&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#39;t cover these then. Same way the healthcare system does not cover plastic surgery&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187&quot;&gt;Nearly all COVID deaths in US are now among unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jahoo.shinyapps.io/vaxpolitics/&quot;&gt;Vaccination status is highly correlated with political affiliation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/paighowal/viz/TrackingCovidVaccinationsintheUS/CovidVaccinationsintheUS&quot;&gt;Total vaccinations are plateauing, showing no sign of increased growth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/&quot;&gt;Projections show we will only ever reach 65% total Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, leaving 100+ million people unvaccinated. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious Caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children, Pregnant Women, and those with legitimate medical condition preventing vaccination should be cared for and protected within reason, provided all medical care necessary, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US should continue to provide vaccines to any and all who want them, and try to reach rural communities who may not have easy access. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Position:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can never eradicate Covid, as it has already become endemic. The vaccines have been proven effective with no long-term side effects, and have been made freely available along with incentives and a massive PR initiative. IE: Covid is an inescapable, but preventable illness at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, we should accept the bodily autonomy of the willingly unvaccinated, and allow them to be infected and/or die of coronavirus.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would even go so far as to say we should allow insurance companies to deny them medical coverage. If they want to take their chances with the virus, that&amp;#39;s their right, and we should let them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we allowed this population to become infected, that population would build some natural biological immunity to current and future covid variants. It would be better to build that immunity now, while the vaccines are still effective, than hold out trying to prevent transmission until a new variant emerges that the vaccines do not work against. The Devil we know (Delta primarily) is better than the Devil we Don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, CMV redditors.&lt;/p&gt;

I broke down and signed up for Peacock (NBC&amp;#39;s new streaming service) because they advertised that they were streaming coverage, only to find out that paying for yet another service wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for full access.  My wife is a horse person and loves the equestrian events, but those weren&amp;#39;t included.  Why?  Probably because I needed to be punished for not having a cable subscription.  It is so sad and totally unnecessary.

&lt;p&gt;China, for example, is a heavily propagandized country but my experience with Chinese people is that they understand that it&amp;#39;s to be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a disproportionate number of Americans think that they aren&amp;#39;t being subjected to propaganda; that their preferred news source is telling it like it really is; that their preferred politicians genuinely care about their well-being. I&amp;#39;d say this applies to both the right and the left but mainstream American politics doesn&amp;#39;t have a left-wing so let&amp;#39;s say it applies to the right and the far-right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this is something I would like to have my mind changed or updated about. Basically, this is the oldest argument against renewable energy. I thought and still think this is a serious problem when it comes to transforming our energy generation, but it seems to be less of a concern in public discourse nowadays, so has something changed? Do we have a solution now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me sketch the argument and my assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power demand varies significantly throughout the day and year, but there is a certain minimum amount of power that has to be available at all times. Baseload power plants are those which put out a constant amount of power, 24 hours of the day, every day. Other sources of energy which are not &amp;quot;baseload&amp;quot; have strongly fluctuating power output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me list the most common methods of energy generation and if they can serve as baseload power plants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseload: oil/coal/gas, nuclear, bio oil and gas, hydro, geothermal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating: Solar, Wind, more unusual things like tidal power etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why do you need baseload power plants? If you basically all of your enegry production comes from fluctuating sources then you need to ensure that your energy production does not vary too much from demand. Underproduction is clearly bad, but as I understood overproduction of energy is NOT a trivial problem either: If your power plant produces power that is not needed at the moment then you can not just get rid of it/waste it in some easy way. This is demonstrated by the fact that negative energy prices are a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean practically? First of all, as I understood, wind (which may actually be baseload), hydro, bio oil and gas, geothermal and other renewable power sources can NOT replace the amount of power generated cussently by fossil fuels and nuclear, simply on a level of power output. Is this wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most countries usually already use all their opportunities for hydro power plants and even if they don&amp;#39;t, there just isn&amp;#39;t a very high maximum possible power output here. Geothermal is more something for individual home power generation and is highly dependent on your geographical location. Wind is good but you would struggle to get anywhere close to what fossils do at the moment only with wind. Bio oil and gas are not very efficient for power generationa s you have to invest power to grow them, they are more useful to be used as a fuel, so efficient power storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only renewable energy which actually seems great to me in terms of raw power output per price is solar. I am 100% convinced that most countries could generate the amount of power they use with solar, the problem is just that the output varies very very significantly between day and night (and summer and winter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(EDIT: So nuclear power is supposed to be excluded here, I&amp;#39;m trying to udnerstand how countries want to do this that want to get rid of nuclear power together with fossil fuels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would have to overbuild solar to deal with the winter and then have too much generated power in summer. And of course the biggest problem are the nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer is power storage to bridge the nights and generally cushion the fluctuations. But I have never heard a good answer to the fact that we don&amp;#39;t have any technology which could give us power storage on a sufficient scale. Batteries are cool and we are making great progress, but it is already a momentuous task to supply enough batteries just for the future EV fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydro energy storage is good but again, the maximum possible capactiy here is just not large enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that I don&amp;#39;t know of any good ways to store enregy whicha aren&amp;#39;t  sitting in laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooooo basically how exactly are we going to do this transition to renewable energies? What is the plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best I can imagine is that EVs will be connected to the grid and then the battery capacity from cars can be used to power homes at night !? But idk man, it seems like batteries are already in really high demand and it will take many decades before most cars are EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively we could invent a new form of power storage, okay, but I don&amp;#39;t know of anything promising.&lt;/p&gt;

The magazine on the cover of her article referred to her using “she/they” as she is happy with either but then only used the “she”pronoun for the rest of the article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always respect people’s pronouns but you can’t have a go at someone for only using one of your preferred pronouns, I feel like this is elitist and is setting up people to feel attacked when they are trying to do the right thing and respect people’s choice of pronouns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit - I also just noticed I also used only the “she” pronoun when writing this and not out of a place of disrespect so please do not attack me but rather try to CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My CMV is pretty much the title. I find it hard to believe that people who take BLM to mean that ONLY Black Lives Matter or some variation of that are either arguing in bad faith and/or are willfully ignorant. I believe that people who think this are attempting to discredit the BLM movement or are refusing to do even a little bit if research into what BLM actually means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting part of this discussion, I think, is that proponents of the &amp;quot;counter-movement&amp;quot; (if you want to call it that) -- Blue Lives Matter -- do not seem to insinuate that ONLY blue lives matter. I take this to mean that they know exactly what BLM means and are being hypocritical about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ypu can change my view by showing me how someone might still somehow not understand what BLM means, or by showing how proponents of Blue Lives Matter are NOT being hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
