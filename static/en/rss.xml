While I can understand this reasoning for many of the existing cultures that had their artifacts taken in recent memory, my primary contention with this for Egypt specifically is that they&amp;#39;re incredibly old. The Egyptians that created these artifacts and all their ancestors are long dead, and the people and government that currently live in Egypt are just the conquerors of the conquerors of the conquerors of the people who did create this artifacts. The British and others took these artifacts from the people who took them from the people who took them from the people who lived there thousands of years ago, their claim doesn&amp;#39;t really seem any less reasonable than those of the current Egyptian people or government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t really believe these artifacts should sit concentrated at a few European museums either, I believe when it comes to things this old they should be considered to be part of our shared heritage as a species and should be equally distributed around the world to all stable countries that could reasonable house them (I could make another argument about how Egypt is not the best place for these artifacts on the basis of the instability of the government alone), so that as many people as possible could see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So CMV, why should these artifacts return to Egypt?&lt;/p&gt;

And any political viewpoint will look insane when taken to its logical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it&amp;#39;s most basic form, a libertarian believes that a person or group of people in government are not capable of knowing what&amp;#39;s best for me as an individual, or you as an individual. This is at it&amp;#39;s worse at the federal level, and gets slightly better as government gets more local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a libertarian wants to reduce the power of government to &lt;strong&gt;only what&amp;#39;s necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is where individual libertarians would have discussions and debate, around what is necessary and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a libertarian could absolutely be for universal healthcare. They might compare what we pay right now on average to the NHS, and see that we actually pay more than they do. Then there could be a discussion that the free market isn&amp;#39;t working right with healthcare because people don&amp;#39;t know what they will pay for the service, and the service is often times non-optional. Thus, it is necessary for the government to fund healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where leftists and libertarians most often disagree is actually around the framing of the discussion. If the subject is social safety nets for example, the leftist will enter the conversation on the assumption that government is the one and only option for providing help to those that need it. The libertarian does not enter the conversation with this assumption. So the conversation is doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t disagreeing about helping people, they are disagreeing about the method of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my view is that libertarianism isn&amp;#39;t any more or less crazy than conservatism or liberalism. Both of the latter philosophies wish to use the government to enforce their views, while libertarianism does not. I don&amp;#39;t find that to be an unreasonable political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a pretty privileged background and none of these issues have impacted my life directly, so I will definitely have pretty big gaps in my understanding. I have made what I think is an honest effort to understand both sides of this debate (which seems to have been set off by a couple recent reddit/twitter posts and the Oli London video), and I feel like I&amp;#39;m reaching a completely different conclusion to the people close to me (and online) that I tend to agree with, so I want to challenge my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I am 100% fine with people being cisgender, transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, transsexual, or whatever else as long as they are doing it in good faith.* Not everybody thinks this way, obviously, so we have this big cultural change underway as people come to grips with gender identity.  Big cultural shifts tend to create really challenging social/cultural knock-on effects. In my mind, this question about racial identity and being transracial is one of them. I don&amp;#39;t think there are easy answers for a lot of these questions, but I think we owe it to eachother to listen, explore, communicate, and compromise. The conversations that I&amp;#39;ve seen so far on the topic of racial identity are far from honest, with arguments like: &amp;quot;Gender dysphoria is a part of psychology [and racial dysphoria isn&amp;#39;t]&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3daui1?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt; (Gender dysphoria wasn&amp;#39;t either, 50 years ago); &amp;quot;Culture and heritage however is lived through communities. It can be  appropriated and abused. A white British person claiming to be  trans-Korean diminishes the experiences and burdens of actual Korean people and communities.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3dc4wt?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; (Gender has a massive cultural component), &amp;quot;Race and Ethnicity is Rooted in Ancestry… You Can’t Just Pick and Choose&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/verve-up/transracial-is-not-the-new-transgender-why-race-and-gender-are-not-synonymous-b2c688ef0fae&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; (sounds a lot like the &amp;#39;gender is rooted in biology&amp;#39; argument to me) and &amp;quot;We also think that, as a result of this asymmetry, transgender identities deserve social uptake and so-called “transracial”  identifications as Black almost always do not. (We leave space for  unique circumstances in which someone who has deeply invested in a Black community and been forthcoming about their racial history is nevertheless accepted within that community as Black.)&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bostonreview.net/race-philosophy-religion-gender-sexuality/robin-dembroff-dee-payton-why-we-shouldnt-compare&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; (there&amp;#39;s obviously massive differences, but this argument isn&amp;#39;t fundamentally different to arguing that trans women aren&amp;#39;t women because they haven&amp;#39;t grown up having periods, experiencing sexism, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside (for now) the existing use of &amp;#39;transracial&amp;#39; used in the context of adopted children raised outside of their biological parents&amp;#39; ethnic/racial cultures, I think that being transracial is similar in a lot of ways to being transgender or transexual, and I don&amp;#39;t see how that de-legitimizes either of those things. I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of fear on the left that this comparison makes the transgender/transsexual struggle look somehow ridiculous or absurd by association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and I guess I can see why people might think that, but it feels like either an unhelpful gut reaction, or (being a bit pessimistic) an overly political/strategic reaction which looks a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thomasnastcartoons.com/2015/01/06/throwing-down-the-ladder-by-which-they-rose-23-july-1870/&quot;&gt;throwing the ladder down&lt;/a&gt;. Every new cultural idea is uncomfortable at first, but we don&amp;#39;t know if it has any merit if we don&amp;#39;t explore it in good faith. I think it&amp;#39;s also a missed opportunity to better understand trans/identity in general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other (original) definition of transracial -- adopted children raised outside their biological parents&amp;#39; culture/race -- I think it&amp;#39;s a really interesting bridge between transsexual identity politics and transracial (the other/new definition) identity politics, because there are hundreds of thousands of cases of transracial adoption, and I&amp;#39;m sure we could learn a lot about culture and identity if we asked them about it.  I expect some of these children experience very real, very complicated dysphoria [citation needed, obviously].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if the likes of Rachel Dolezal, Oli London, Ja Du, Ekundayo, etc are charlatans or people in genuine turmoil deserving of, if not our sympathy, at least our patience. What I do know is that this kind of tectonic cultural shift has happened enough times throughout history that I think I want to hedge my bets and at least be kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Quick aside:  I don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;as long as it isn&amp;#39;t hurting anyone&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve observed that change hurts, and a lot of people are experiencing real pain caused by this big cultural shift in favor of trans rights and that&amp;#39;s unavoidable. However, I think there will always be charlatans out there who take advantage of the opportunity that any big disruption creates, so that&amp;#39;s why I say &amp;#39;in good faith&amp;#39;. You can pick your example of this, from people &amp;#39;playing the race card&amp;#39; to children setting their screen names to &amp;#39;Connecting...&amp;#39; to get out of zoom/skype classes during a pandemic. Big changes create opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a meaningful difference between &amp;quot;permanent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;indefinite&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;

Politicians are throwing numbers around left and right. After the debate is over you have another 30-45 minutes of programming dedicated to fact-checking what they said, again without any sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a political debate, politicians should be allowed to prepare a presentation for each of the big questions that are released beforehand. These should be backed up by easily accessible sources, so that the viewers can verify the claims if they want to, while they are watching the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it goes into the shorter rapid-fire debates between two candidates this obviously isn&amp;#39;t feasible. Instead, I feel like the respective campaigns should be forced to put out a statement afterward citing sources for as many of the points their candidate made as is possible. If they said something that can&amp;#39;t be backed up, then they issue an apology and a clarification. This would preferably be done at the next debate or some other televised event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is far from perfect and that it&amp;#39;s possible to find sources supporting most opinions. However, politicians have been known to just spout random &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; that are later proven false. I think this would go a small way to deter this type of behavior, without decreasing the viewability or essence of a political debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT… I do strongly believe that the connection between how you feel (your energy, outlook, emotions, cognition, decision making abilities) is not brought to the forefront of solving issues like depression, unproductiveness, and aggression like it should. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody is willing to acknowledge that diet and sleep have profound effects on health but very few seem to actually realise it and apply it to themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not I feel as though that ‘tiring job’ or ‘draining relationship’ is more a result of a poor diet and sleep regime than it is actual social interactions having an effect. No, you are not tired on Saturday because you ‘just finished an exhausting work week’, you are tired because you eat and sleep like shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, hormones can be influenced by social interactions, but over a long period of time I see their effects as minimal in comparison to a good regime. (I’m saying this to attribute more of the effect to diet and sleep, I’m not saying that severe events like a loved one’s passing can’t sometimes overpower the effects of diet and sleep). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I’m in the prime of my life physically and I don’t expect the entire population to have my level of energy or sharpness so I realise my bias, but I don’t think people without prexisting conditions are doomed to things like midday lethargy and morning grogginess. On a good day of eating and sleeping I have energy throughout and feel cognitively present at all times, regardless of my social context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, also, what is with normalising things like lethargy, headaches, and brain fog?? I constantly see people accept things like post-meal lethargy as concrete and unchangeable. People literally plan their days around when they’ll be lethargic instead of actually trying to fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me started on the neurodepressive effects of eating and sleeping like garbage. Not saying all cases of depression can be solved with those two things alone, but they can certainly be greatly ameliorated by them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realisation translates into action. 2/3rds of the American popular is overweight, if that doesn’t show that this isn’t an unpopular sentiment I don’t know what does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Kick me down a peg I’ve been lurking pubmed and NCBI for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also this isn’t intended to invalidate other aspects of self care)&lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;#39;re actually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reading sections of the SAT/ACT perhaps leave the most to be desired. Being able to parse text from 300 years ago is to a large degree a function of having experience reading text from 300 years ago. So, when you get a reading passage like that, it&amp;#39;s testing if you read older books a lot. There&amp;#39;s also the matter of questions that start to venture into a certain bit of subjectivity. &amp;quot;Choose the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; answer&amp;quot; they say, and I&amp;#39;ve come upon times where I didn&amp;#39;t entirely agree with what they thought was the &amp;#39;best answer&amp;#39;. This is why I personally would be able to get a perfect score on math sections time and time again, but might get 1 or 2 wrong in the reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grammar sections are better. Gone are the old &amp;#39;this is to that and that is to...&amp;#39; questions, which tested raw vocabulary, and instead it&amp;#39;s mostly testing to see if you understand English. Yes, language evolves, but every needs to learn how to write and speak well in the formal standard of our times, as a practical thing. We want to prepare people to go into job interviews and the like and be able to be well-spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math sections really didn&amp;#39;t need that many changes, as they are entirely solid. They do exactly what they should: Take material from school, and give it a little bit of a twist that tests a deeper understanding. Excellent. This simultaneously tests a bit of what you learned, and how well you can think. I might give a certain amount of more difficult questions on the SAT, but overall I think it&amp;#39;s a very good evaluation tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the proof of that is that you can&amp;#39;t really &amp;#39;crack the code&amp;#39; - I&amp;#39;ve had parents in the past who unfortunately wanted me to arrive with some sort of secret formula to a high score, and the reality is that there isn&amp;#39;t one, because the test is well designed. The secret to a better score is &amp;quot;learn the material, and beyond that have a high IQ&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tests are different, but in a proper way. The GRE kind of abandons the idea of testing your high school learning, because it knows you just spent 4 years in college in who knows what major. Better to test you in ways that don&amp;#39;t require a lot of rote math knowledge, but more reasoning skills that are universal - and that&amp;#39;s exactly what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LSAT, for law school admission, is the closest to a pure IQ test. I kinda gave up on tutoring it, because the reality was there was only so much I could do for people...because it&amp;#39;s an IQ test! I would have gotten above 170 the first time I ever saw the material, because I have a very high IQ, and experience with the questions over time brings me up another 5 points probably. Nothing I can teach you is going to bring you from a 140 to a 180. Nothing. It&amp;#39;s an IQ test. And that&amp;#39;s fitting for law school, where you&amp;#39;re going to want a difficult test for elite-level cognitive and reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are these tests perfect? No, and they couldn&amp;#39;t be. Are they generally pretty good though? Yes, absolutely. Do they give you a very solid baseline impression of the student you would be getting for your school or program? Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think people who dislike them tend to do so for the simple reason that they find them hard and don&amp;#39;t score well on them. And to address some other concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t the tests culturally biased?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they&amp;#39;re not. Even decades ago, where you might occasionally get a question about a &amp;quot;silo&amp;quot; or something that had disparate familiarity to different regions or people, that effect would have been small. Now they&amp;#39;ve gotten very careful about such things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you can get to cultural bias now is if you go to crazy town where math itself is culturally biased, or the very concept of correct empirical answers is a symptom of white patriarchy. Yeah, there are people who go there, sadly, but they certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be listened to by anyone serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But isn&amp;#39;t IQ testing is flawed, and aren&amp;#39;t there are multiple kinds of intelligence?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. At least, certainly not to the degree that gets around, again, spread by people with a certain agenda. The reality is that IQ testing is incredibly robust and predictive, possibly more so than any other psychological metric available. I crush basically all standardized tests, and always have, because the cognitive ability I apply to a test translates super readily through sections of that test, and to all the other tests as well. In high school I got a perfect score on sections of the SAT and ACT without any studying. And equivalently, I tend to score like 140 or so on IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that kind of invalidate your job?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit, yes. Like I said, I gave up teaching the LSAT because I felt full of shit. But I can certainly teach someone the rote math and grammar rules they need for the high school tests, and improve their score. Again, no one is going from a 430 to an 800 on an SAT section, but a 600 might be in the cards with some work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why do people dislike these tests so much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, because they themselves aren&amp;#39;t very good at them, or their kids don&amp;#39;t do well on them, and that makes them feel bad. So they try to say they don&amp;#39;t measure anything. There&amp;#39;s also a larger cultural movement that tries to dismantle all of these things if it&amp;#39;s shown that results are disparate among different races or sexes, because then that could only be the fault of the test being wrong and evil to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What could we do better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was designing it from the ground up, I would have one test that was pure cognitive/IQ, and other tests that were tests of learned knowledge. You also want the math testing to have a harder curve into more difficult questions, because as it is getting a perfect on the math SAT or ACT is actually quite easy, and so there are students who might be exceptionally capable whose abilities won&amp;#39;t show up. The Korean CSAT is actually an awesome test - the English section is literally better than our English section, and the math section shows a nice road map to me of the level we should be both be teaching advanced students to, and testing them at.&lt;/p&gt;

They live together, are monogamous, travel together, bond with other’s families, and don’t seem to have any signs of breaking up anytime soon. They just don’t feel like they need a piece of paper to prove their love. You mean to tell me that they have less commitment than what society considers, “married”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, traditional marriage also feels like a scam. I mean, If it doesn’t workout, it only leave you more debt if you can’t afford a prenup. These other legal benefits is unfair  because why is it that only married couples can visit each other in the hospital and get have marital tax deductions and all that? Their love is no more special than the couple I mentioned in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t even taking into consideration all of this “patriotism” is really just commercialization of the flag and drives revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know human memory can be fickle. Remembering something exactly as it happened even 5 hours prior can prove to have some inconsistencies. It would be up to the DA’s Office to pull past reports from the officer, other reports from serving officers, available eye witness testimony and video evidence to show that this was not a case of remembering something incorrectly… but a blatant attempt to make the situation different than it was to excuse/condone the cops behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many cases of false reports come to my head at the moment. However, I recently saw one in New Jersey where a cop beat a guy in a hallway. He claimed the guy failed to raise his hands once told and also attacked the cop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one was a few years ago in a more high profile case, McDonald in Chicago. Several cops wrote in their report something that was incorrect once seen on camera. If one guy remembers something in correctly. Understandable…. If multiple remember something that didn’t happen but in the same manner… something is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions alone (regardless of any other actions by the cop or suspect) should be enough for time behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

Youtube is a banned website in China, so why is China posting on youtube? Two reasons, one to spread their propaganda to the west to indoctrinate followers.  Two, in China there is a massive gray area, and many Chinese people have VPNs and brouse western websites such as youtube.  If China broadcasts their message on western websites which Chinese users have to download a VPN and enter a legal gray area to view, it will further drive home the message the CCP is right.  This is why if you search up Chinese youtube content, you can quickly find numerous channels run by westerners in China who are straight up CCP apologists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example of straight up propaganda, with the CCP trying to cover up their genocidal camps.  I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty easy to find CCP officials on twitter as well, here&amp;#39;s two examples &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zlj517?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/zlj517?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hua Chunying is another spokesperson for the Chinese foreign affairs agency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through their twitter feeds, I can find numerous examples of CCP propaganda, such as deflecting from the genocide in Xinjiang by criticizing the recent news in Canada about bodies found at reform schools.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this stuff allowed? Twitter and Youtube are literally banned in mainland China, so why are CCP government officials allowed on these platforms? They should be banned right back, All their presence does is spew misinformation and lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background; I&amp;#39;m reading this book &amp;#39;No Pity&amp;#39; for a class. I have not finished the book but in the first chapter there are some claims I disagree with. I feel ablest for holding these views but they seem to be right to me. So here I am. I have my degree in philosophy and I&amp;#39;m fairly progressive so I feel I am open to opposing view points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disabled as a minority group are very interesting because they are the only minority group that anyone can join and virtually any time. For very many people it is inevitable as they climb into old age. So when thinking of the plights of this minority group one must understand this can be them tomorrow if not with in 10, 20, or even 30 years from now. They could be your children or eventually your parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were a possibility wouldn’t you want to prevent any and all of these people, including yourself, from these conditions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but to see it as a necessarily better condition to be in an able body than a disabled one. Ignoring this count I really don&amp;#39;t think I hold any other prejudices against any disabled person. I do not judge anyone by their disability. I think part of the government&amp;#39;s job is to account for the differences in the biological lottery. Thus it’s part of the government&amp;#39;s job to provide services for the disabled so they can live as independently as possible. Just the same as the government does for low income individuals. It’s all a part of the social safety net. The disabled population has a lot of untapped skills and talent because of people&amp;#39;s prejudices and that is a shame. A disabled person doesn&amp;#39;t have to be Steven Hawking to have a positive influence on the culture and society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my point; In the book people are quoted saying to the effect that if a miracle cure was developed overnight would they take it? And all of them say no. This way I can understand your whole experience and identity is wrapped up in your material experience. Of course you don&amp;#39;t want to change who you are. Change is hard and who says this change is necessarily worth it if you have your life together already. Being able to see or walk or hear wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily make you a ‘better’ person. If anything, being abled will serve to alienate you from your community. As much as I don&amp;#39;t agree, I can respect this opinion and understand that my opinion really is meaningless to this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am having a really hard time understanding is this; “Most stunning was the finding announced in 1992 of the precise DNA location of the gene that caused myotonic dystrophy. Yet, once again, these breakthroughs were not cures so much as prevention measures. And to the new disability rights movement prevention had ominous overtones. Many activists fear that with the growth of such predictive tests, pregnant women will be expected or coerced to abort fetuses when there is an indication of disability. Others worry that if genetic engineering can one day wipe out an illness, a person who already has that disability will be seen as a freak or devalued as a preventable mistake.” I understand wanting to prevent social stigma that is always a fight worth having. But if we can make it so no one ever has to deal with a particular disability again then why not do preventable treatments with genetic engineering? For example if we find a miracle cure for mental retardation then why not utilize it? On the note of abortions I think that it is the women’s choice. She should not be convinced of a decision; she should make the choice herself. No one can tell anyone what to do with their bodies plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please convince me otherwise if you can. I am very interested to see some opposing arguments!&lt;/p&gt;

I know many people will say, &amp;quot;well, like it or not, you&amp;#39;re an adult at 18.&amp;quot; But we&amp;#39;ve determined as a society, in the US at least, that some adults (i.e., those under 21) cannot consume alcohol or cannabis (and even tobacco now in many places); thus, we already have exceptions when it comes to liberties one enjoys at age 18. This isn&amp;#39;t without precedent. And just so it&amp;#39;s explicit, I think this should apply to all genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am making this argument for three main reasons. First, on a societal level, I think having 18 and 19 year olds in the sex work industry promotes ephebophilia in our culture (think about the popularity of the search term &amp;quot;teen&amp;quot; across many porn platforms...). Raising the age to 21 would at least reduce this widespread fantasy of someone &amp;quot;fresh out of high school.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that I think raising the minimum age of workers could help mitigate some of the coercion and predatory practices that can unfortunately co-occur in the industry (e.g., what was shown in Hot Girls Wanted). I think as people get older, especially after working a job or two, they tend to get a better sense of their self-worth, both as an individual and as a worker. Again, I know this would not eliminate bad actors in the industry, but I do think raising the average age of workers would act as a buffer to some of the more unsavory practices that can accompany sex work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and somewhat related to the point above, I honestly think many people are not mature enough to make a potentially life-altering career decision at such a young age as 18. Based on personal experience being acquainted with people who have done some form of sex work (mostly stripping) and interviews with some pornstars/escorts I have seen, it strikes me that some people are cut out for it and some people are simply not. And, sadly, I think it can lead to a lot of regret and pain if you get too deep into it before knowing you&amp;#39;re not the type of person who can engage in the act of trading some sort of sexual service for money. Not to mention the fallout from doing (and later regretting) something like porn where there is a potentially permanent electronic record of your work. The short but developmentally critical transition period from adolescence to young adulthood (i.e., 18-21) should be about exploring your sexuality on your own personal terms before deciding you want to monetize and make a career of it for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that people may think this comes off as too paternalistic or sex-negative. Maybe it is, but again, we already do this in varying degrees in other domains in our society, so I&amp;#39;m not sure why this should be any different. I suppose you could change my view by presenting me some data to suggest that this would be impossible/ineffective or by enlightening me about some aspect or nuance of sex work that I&amp;#39;m ignoring or misunderstanding (insight from people who have worked in the industry would be especially welcome).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

I am half chinese/half white.  My mom is 100% Chinese, born in Hong Kong.  My fiancee is 100% white (for lack of a better term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all playing golf and saw an older Asian couple playing a second round.  The course attendant asked if they paid for a second round.  They said they didn&amp;#39;t think they needed to since no one else was using the course and already paid once.  He said they can&amp;#39;t do that, they paid for 1 round and only 1 round.  They were free to play again, they would just have to pay for another round.  I would think once you got caught, you&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;my bad&amp;quot; and leave the course, but apparently the guy had to keep explaining why they can&amp;#39;t play for free just because there&amp;#39;s no one behind them.  They were still talking by the time we got to our car and pulling out like 5 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom said something along the lines of &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s such a Chinese thing to do&amp;quot;.  My fiancee said we can&amp;#39;t say things like that, because it personally offends her.  I&amp;#39;m confused how someone of an unrelated race can be personally offended on behalf of another race for something said within that race.  I&amp;#39;d like to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I&amp;#39;ve also played extra holes at a course.  But you do that in the middle like holes 5-7.  And if I got talked to about it, I&amp;#39;d take the rightful blame, say I was in the wrong, and leave.  I&amp;#39;d never start at hole #1 like this couple did, that&amp;#39;s just asking to be talked to by the staff.  It&amp;#39;s also very obvious when last tee time is 7-730pm, and this couple is starting at hole #1 at like 8:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I said it below in another comment and after seeing what people said I should have used &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t be offended&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t be offended&amp;quot;.  And again that&amp;#39;s my opinion/view.  But anyone can be offended about anything, that&amp;#39;s their right.  Whether any change comes of it once that opinion if brought up is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think it would be out of place for me to have a stance that I would tell someone of a different race/gender what they can/can&amp;#39;t say about that particular race/gender that I&amp;#39;ve never been associated with or been a part of.  Especially when that statement is not intentionally derogatory, or mean spirited, more of &amp;quot;yup, that doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me, based on my personal experiences of being part of that group&amp;quot;.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell a black person what it means to other black people when certain things are said, like I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell someone that identifies as a woman that they can/can&amp;#39;t say things about other woman since I don&amp;#39;t know how it feels to be in that particular group.&lt;/p&gt;

The definition of hallucination is &amp;quot;a sensory experience that appears real, but is created by the mind&amp;quot;. - paraphrased from Healthline. This is often a symptom of several illnesses, so we can conclude that the person who claims to see/hear a deity has an illness, because nobody else can perceive what the other hears/sees. I think that claiming to see/hear a deity has no basis in reality, whatsoever, can potentially cause the person to do dangerous things and is very strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I perfectly accept that it is not in their control, and it is perfectly OK to have an illness, whether that be of mind or body, but why isn&amp;#39;t people claiming to see/hear deities viewed as an illness by doctors? Serious question. Any attempts to change my view, &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; from anybody working in the medical field will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I can see some potential harm stemming from this type content in the form of a small percentage of their audiences who not only get enjoyment from reinforcing racial stereotypes but use it as an excuse to negatively discriminate or harm minorities. But in the long run I don&amp;#39;t see how pushing the comedic no go zone further and further towards what is politically correct is the most beneficial option. Ignorant people are everywhere, and trying to force society into a utopian world free of racism is a pipe dream which may only exacerbate racial issues. I think this type of racially stereotypical comedy gives these small minded people an opportunity to vent their prejudices openly for others to criticize rather than in a manner that is much more organized, insidious and underground. This type of comedy is the lesser of two evils, resulting in I believe nothing more than some hurt feelings and oftentimes bad comedy, whereas removing such an avenue may result in something similar to the beer halls of 20th century Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve thought about this for a while so I would like to see how my argument can be challenged and if possibly I am not looking at this the right way or haven&amp;#39;t taken something into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft should be entirely abolished it&amp;#39;s not needed, it&amp;#39;s outdated, and it isn&amp;#39;t a working model in the US military. The military doesn&amp;#39;t even want to have to use the draft. It&amp;#39;s a shit institution that doesn&amp;#39;t work in the US. Compulsory service works in other countries but not ours. My reasonings are as followed with supporting links or as many as I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sss.gov/history-and-records/induction-statistics/&quot;&gt;They&amp;#39;ve statistically used it less each time&lt;/a&gt; during ww1 over 50% were draftees. By Vietnam era, it was less than 30% across all four branches and less than 20% of the draftees were sent to combat or hot zones.  Culminating in only 676 individuals being drafted in 1973. Little historical fact we even drafted people on both sides during the civil war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.) Vietnam gave rise to the professional or career soldier, we have one of the strongest volunteer forces in the world. The military is not hurting for people they turn people away every day and give out pink slips to people who are in Military Occupations that are overcrowded or phases out because it&amp;#39;s obsolete. Example of this would be barbers, yes king of the hill was accurate on that they did once exist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/6-awesome-army-jobs-that-no-longer-exist/&quot;&gt;List of six jobs (though there are more) that no longer exist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easier to be disqualified than qualified for service and women on average are more qualified than men. Which is just one of the reasons that they opened up the combat arms military occupational specialties to women to broaden the pool from which they can recruit. There are several factors of why this is but, &lt;a href=&quot;https://militarybenefits.info/army-height-weight-requirements/&quot;&gt;weight and height&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-medical-conditions.html&quot;&gt;general health&lt;/a&gt;, less likely to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalancecareers.com/us-military-enlistment-standards-3354006&quot;&gt;criminal record&lt;/a&gt;, better scores on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-test-explained.html&quot;&gt;ASVAB (armed service aptitude battery test)&lt;/a&gt;, etc to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.) Draftees are bad for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cohesion#:%7E:text=Unit%20cohesion%20is%20a%20military,despite%20combat%20or%20mission%20stress%22.&quot;&gt;unit cohesion (may not seem important but it is a very important component for a functioning military)&lt;/a&gt; and the emotional health of those around them. They also can be extremely dangerous and end up getting themselves or someone else killed. We learned this during Vietnam. They tend to be undisciplined, unmotivated, poorly trained because it&amp;#39;s about quantity not quality ,and let&amp;#39;s add-in you&amp;#39;re taking people who don&amp;#39;t want to be somewhere training them to kill, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/5172/drawn-into-violence-evidence-on-what-makes-a-criminal-from-the-vietnam-draft-lotteries&quot;&gt;then handing them a loaded weapon&lt;/a&gt;. What could go wrong? Look up friendly fire and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.historynet.com/the-hard-truth-about-fragging.htm&quot;&gt;fragging incidents&lt;/a&gt; that happened during Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.) The US military has backups with more backups in place to avoid using the draft at all costs. Everyone that signs an enlistment contract agrees to double time. For example, you sign a four-year contract with the US Army to be a 13b (cannon crew member in field artillery) what you owe them is 8 years. 4 years active, and upon release of service you owe 4 more years in the IRR or inactive ready reserve. During which time you can be recalled to active duty. Some specialized jobs allow up to 10 years. It&amp;#39;s cheaper, cost and time effective to bring back people who already have been trained and just give them a refresher course versus the time and money it takes to train a new recruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in the event another 9/11 happened they would &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.) first recall all IRR at any given time that&amp;#39;s over a million people at any given time that fall within the window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;B.) The next step they would take is lowering the standards for entrance. In point 2 I mentioned it&amp;#39;s difficult well now all those people that would ordinarily be turned away for hand tattoos, face tattoos, low scores on the ASVAB, that person that had therapy one time as a kid, that individual that had a bit of a criminal record, etc are now being taken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.) They activate the National Guard of each state and the Reservists of each branch placing them on active duty orders. (We have tons of these).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.) Stop loss is initatied any service members contracts that were about to expire are now extended preventing force loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.) And if all of that fails to provide enough then and only then is the draft activated by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch, if you&amp;#39;re overweight, have a history of mental illness, health problems, too short, under 18, in your mid-30s, in college, can&amp;#39;t meet even the lowered standard on the ASVAB which shows you are cannot be  trained (not joking there are people that try on this test and want to be in who score below the minimum 31 out of 99 there are people who score in the single digits), that ASVAB you took in high school already let them know of you were qualified or not so if you bombed it your name wouldn&amp;#39;t even be up for consideration of the draft board, a single parent and you have full custody of your kid, you&amp;#39;re not going to get drafted. As it stands right now with no draft and no lowered standard males of 18-34(?) only 49% of the them are deemed fit for service. Females the numbers are at 51% is qualified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.) We don&amp;#39;t fight the way we used to fight, warfare has evolved we aren&amp;#39;t just throwing body after body at targets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_99anv02.html&quot;&gt;We use technology&lt;/a&gt; that has allowed us to go from 2.7 million during the height of the Vietnam War to 1.4 million with us fighting on two fronts. Technology has cut the need in half because we are able to use it as a force multiplier vs using actual physical bodies. Not to mention all the other operations that take place every day that the general public is unaware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.) Draftees legally are only required to serve a year deployed. Ie one tour, it costs more money using the draft because they have to get a fresh batch in every year as opposed to regular volunteer enlisted members who they can use what&amp;#39;s called stop-loss where they involuntarily extend the service members contract. It costs approximately $90,000 to train and equip one infantryman in the military and their training is only 22 weeks un the Army. That&amp;#39;s just through training, now imagine that plus not to mention the wasted money and man-hours spent chasing down draft dodgers. The draft is not cheap nor is it a sustainable model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft is not needed, it&amp;#39;s outdated, ineffective, and the military DOES NOT want draftees there because historically they cause more problems and are a hindrance. It shouldn&amp;#39;t include women it should be completely abolished.&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;#39;s all you see in the new, on social media and especially on Reddit . My view is that there has never ever been a better time to be alive. For anyone, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food has never been more plentiful, despite increasing populations. Almost every key resources are plentiful despite record populations. The share of income spent on food has steeply declined as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A higher percentage of children make it through childhood today than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to knowledge has never been easier, and cheaper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air quality world wide has never been better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global poverty is at an all time low. Child labor world wide is on a steep decline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global literacy rate is at an all time high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal freedom is most countries is also at an all time high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards of living in almost every country has drastically increased. In developed countries, you have access to news, entertainment, food, flights, games at the press of a few buttons.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think anyone needs convincing how much better modern medicine has made the world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never been more accessible for the average person to start a business or make money from personal projects or creative works, eg on Youtube, Instagrams or small online stores. Small side gigs have never been so profitable and accessible (Uber, DoorDash etc) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been been more possibilities available to the average person on Earth. And more people than ever before have access to this level of leisure time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, technological innovations are on the rise, promising even better medicine, education and living standards in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time there&amp;#39;s a fresh outrage we get more bans, more restrictions and more of a political divide between groups of people, the platforms control you a little more and everyone distracts each other with congratulations on an outrage well done. Meanwhile the big boys up top continue to seize more and more control without us ever really noticing. They don&amp;#39;t care one bit about your politics or your feelings, they just see an opportunity to exploit this current political environment to seize control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no clue how these algorithms work and they&amp;#39;re starting to get pretty spooky. I believe we&amp;#39;re perched in a very precarious state right now with no clear out. It&amp;#39;s impossible to trust anything because you really never know why you&amp;#39;re being shown something and you don&amp;#39;t know where it originated from. Especially on TikTok, we truly have no idea what TikTok does, it&amp;#39;s completely opaque and hails straight from China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I have believed that the term African-American is racist for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lumps all black people into the same category as being African. The person being referred to as African may be from Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands etc., or their grandparents or great-grandparents were from there. They may have no closer ancestry to any area in Africa than a white American with English ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term becomes useless as soon as the person is in America but not American. Then what are they called? Black. So I don’t see the point in calling someone African-American instead of black when the next black person who isn’t American you have to use a term for, you call them black anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It segregates different colours for absolutely no reason and is totally unnecessary. What do they call a black German person? Do they call them African-German? No, they’re just German. They’re as German as anyone else. Calling someone African-American instead of just American suggests that they’re not the same as a white American, which they are. They’re born in the United States or are naturalised, they might never have been to Africa in their lives and have no African relatives, so they’re not African-American, they’re just American. Otherwise any white American needs to be referred to as English-American or Irish-American or Slovakian-American, instead of being categorised as white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a more polite way of saying someone is black, or a categorisation or any other use of the term, it just seems racist to me to call someone ‘African’ because they’re black regardless of what their background or heritage is, and no other country I can think of categorises their black citizens or any other BAME people as ‘African’ or ‘Asian’ or anything else. Germans are Germans, Australians are Australians, Americans should be Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been homeless nor poor, I’m upper middle class. However, I never look down on the homeless and give them money instead of outright giving food to them. I feel the only people who get butthurt are those who offer food just to boost their ego. If I were homeless, I’d never take someone’s half eaten food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see so many posts saying “I only ever offer food because the money will go to drugs”. That’s not why you’re not giving money…I’m sick of people bullshitting with that excuse to not give money. Besides, don’t people ever think that maybe the homeless guy just ate? Or he can’t carry 100 McDonald’s sandwiches that people offer him? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because he turns down your food that you thought was gourmet, doesn’t mean he’s a choosy beggar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think it’s perfectly fine to give someone food if they ask for it. What I have a problem with is the people who go up to homeless offering their leftovers, then getting angry when the homeless guy turns the food down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to improve myself and follow the teachings of my religion, but it seems like some people don&amp;#39;t even TRY to follow the teachings of the religion that they claim to be a part of. They don&amp;#39;t attend religious services often when it is expected of them, break many commandments that their religion has and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that the teachings of many religions talk about being accepting of those who are trying to improve themselves and to not be too judgmental of those who choose to &amp;quot;sin&amp;quot;, but there has to be a point where the  religious devotions they do offer every once in a while could be seen as mocking in a way towards the higher power they profess to believe in and worship, but they spend MUCH more time thinking of the next one night stand, cookout, night out with their friends binge drinking, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that they would be more comfortable embracing a belief system that excludes a higher power and religious devotion so they don&amp;#39;t feel like they&amp;#39;re stuck in a devotion system that they aren&amp;#39;t truly involved with. You&amp;#39;re outwardly expressing the beliefs you have on the inside of yourself. Sure, you may disappoint friends and family you have who are religious, but it beats the inner turmoil of being in a part of a belief system you begrudgingly accept for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if an individual who is female by sex decides they are non-binary, they are compartmentalizing the definition of a woman. What does it mean to be a woman? Dresses and makeup? If you said yes to the previous question, you are stereotyping. Not all women wear dresses, not all women wear makeup, not all women have vaginas, and not all women “feel” like women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened to having pride in being a woman, even if you don’t follow the stereotype? Even if you prefer a boyish haircut and a “not-so-feminine” voice and plaid button-ups, you can have pride in being part of the diversity of women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that non-binary is a liberation of the self and breaking free from society’s definitions of man and woman, but removing yourself from your gender label emphasizes that men and women must follow their conventional roles, making the situation even worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather live in a world where being called he or she doesn’t connotate stereotypes than in a world where a myriad of pronoun possibilities nuance the non-women and non-man qualities and force harsher stereotypes on those who are called he or she. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** I would like to clarify that I am discussing non-binary genders. Transgender (ftm or mtf) is something else since they are not alienating their assigned sex/gender because they don’t feel “manly” enough to be male; they identify with the other gender because they identify with the other gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear from the beginning. I think that anyone who is against fairness or equal chances should significantly rethink their life philosophy. Being discriminated based on gender / race / etc is horrible and we should do everything in our power to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, from what I notice, the number one initiative to tackles this issue is to impose a diversity quota. You all see this : we commit to have 50% of our board members females, or x% of our workforce latino, etc (depends on the geography as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My assumption is that this strategy is to “force” change, by setting these targets. In essence, any organization with such a target needs to do everything in their power to change the way they recruit and promote talent to reach that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also assume this kind of initiatives happen mostly in highly skilled white collar workforce organizations. I don’t see anyone advocating we increase the % of men as hairdressers, % of women as bricklayers, % of blacks in sports, or even ridiculous things like a quotas for prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I think that these type of policies have the opposite effect than intended. What happens is that companies blindly promote and recruit based on diversity rather than best talent. This leads to more conflict as we are creating environments where employees feel treated unfair since whatever population is underrepresented is privileged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we not rather focusing on creating equal chances? Blind CVs, better maternity/paternity rules, inclusion trainings, etc. If we treat the process fair, why care if the result is 70%women- 30%men , or whatever you want to measure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very curious what you have to say!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Really interesting conversations! Thanks for the people who took their time to answer. While I do think a lot of the comments are going off topic, I definitely learned more about this issue. In reading more about the topic, I came across some interesting materials. Have a look if you are interested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still not convinced that gender quotas is the right way to go forward, and do believe that there are unintended consequences. However, I am optimistic for the future and hope all of us who feel under represented will see better days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of hearing people use the argument: “because it is not physically addictive, it isn’t addictive”, yet they seem to forget that things like gambling, sex, video games etc… are addictions that ruins people lives and I see no one denying their destructive potential despite them only being psychologically addictive, in my own experience I see people smoke weed from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to bed, yet they have the audacity to tell me they don’t have an addiction, even myself I’ve struggled to quit it in the past despite many attempts, that is indeed an addiction and there’s no other way of putting it, I see pot smokers deny their addiction the same way gamblers or other people who have problems downplay their habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather is an old-school conservative meaning he values honesty, respect for the family, honor, respect for traditions, hard work, patriotism/racist nationalism type of nonsense, and believes in the traditional family model is better for society. Also, my grandfather states that society in the past was better mostly in terms of economics and culture. Like people were better back in the day and were more honest, and it&amp;#39;s said that more countries are throwing away their own cultures just to be more western.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started having a conservation with my grandfather about whether, or not, I should go back to college for a philosophy/creative writing degree. I explained to my grandfather that another option was to become a tradesman like an electrician. Of note his also a retired electrician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried to explain by using logical examples in the real world, and used publish data with statistics. He said &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with liberal arts degrees if that&amp;#39;s your passion. However, it&amp;#39;s kinda different back in my day, where if you got a degree it actually met something to the employer and showed the employer that you either were above intelligence or were insanely hard-working. Now, everyone has a degree and it&amp;#39;s flooded the market more. So, unless you are going into engineering, or STEM what is a marketable skill. I think you should stay away from these degrees&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I love my grandfather. But, I just disagree with him on a lot of other issues. Another example is that he tells me that society was better back in his day in terms of economics and feels sorry for the younger generations like me Gen Z and how it&amp;#39;s going to be even harder for future generations to even own a house, and how societies are changing, but it&amp;#39;s in a bad way like losing your native culture, and automation becoming into play. Meaning people who built up careers and worked hard for are going to be out of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He offered another suggestion like go into the skilled trades like being an electrician it&amp;#39;s well paid and very unlikely to be automated out of existence. And, suggested play to your strengths and weaknesses. If you are good at math either go into the electrical trade or engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I love my grandfather. But, I just disagree with him a lot like a more progressive thinking person. Additionally, what my grandfather said was this final piece of life advice he suggested. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Son, I love you dearly but be prepared for some of your views on things to change with experience and age. I used to be very idealistic and young as well. However, this is a very different world, I came into when I was your age. Now, you need to more cunning and adaptable to today&amp;#39;s society and work hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, he&amp;#39;s right on some things, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean just being older you know better. He once stated to me that, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You, know, I may be old, but I&amp;#39;m not stupid, I&amp;#39;ve done my research and just looking out for you son, you&amp;#39;ll get further in life with self-education like reading books on investing, and finance&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit shocked he even knew the names of current generations like millennial, gen z, and gen xer, and modern-day terms. Yes, I get it even in old age you can still be adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;

This evidently applies to their own citizens. However obtaining those documents generally has a cost. IMO such documents should always be free for a citizen. Lack of income should never make someone automatically illegal, nor complying with the law should have a non-income/asset based cost. Furthermore you should never be forced by law to buy a service; either you charge in the form of taxation (based on income, activity and/or assets), or you have it free. Forcing to buy goes against any logic of consumer choice, and should instead be done through a mandatory tax, or simply not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: exception can be made for consular services, as those are essentially a favor the country of origin does to its expats. So long as they can have it free in their homeland and are allowed to return (there exists adhoc traveling documents for undocumented people). Leaving was a choice, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure at what age I would suggest the retest takes place, but I believe it should be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main point behind this is that it would make the roadways a safer place, not just for other drivers, but for older folks driving as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’d like to give &lt;del&gt;3&lt;/del&gt; 4 personal anecdotes which explain my position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I had a neighbor (in his late 70s) who was killed in a car accident where he pulled out in front of an 18 wheeler. His physical health had been deteriorating for a while now and although this could happen to anyone at any age I believe it to be a result of his age and physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandma has Alzheimer’s and in the earliest stages of it she ran a stop sign and t-boned another vehicle. I find it unlikely this would have happened had she been retested, because she probably wouldn’t have been declared fit to drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was cut off while traveling 45MPH and tboned a car very violently. Both our cars were totaled and although I escaped with minor injuries, the driver (elderly) who cut me off suffered a few broken bones. Both the witnesses who pulled over and the police very quickly determined it was his fault. (Also he tried to sue me after wtf!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got cut of today by an older gentleman and was about 2 feet away from slamming into his bumper had I not been paying attention, it would’ve been a pretty bad accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident is what reminded me about how I think we could make the roads safer for all by reevaluating who in our elderly population is still fit to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic understanding is that one reason that corporations are able to spend extravagant funding on political campaigns in the USA is that (a) they have been ruled to legally count as &amp;#39;people&amp;#39; and (b) money has been ruled to be a form of speech - hence donating money to political campaigns is a constitutionally protected right. I personally am opposed to both of these ideas, but if we&amp;#39;re stuck with them, I don&amp;#39;t see why we  shouldn&amp;#39;t come up with some additional ways of criminally punishing corporations beyond fines small enough to just be a cost of doing business. For example, instead of just fining companies, why not prohibit them from doing any business for some amount of time (ie &amp;#39;imprison&amp;#39; them)? They might be prohibited from selling, transporting, purchasing, or manufacturing products, purchasing labor, and a freeze could be placed on trading their stock. This seems like it might actually provide corporations with good reasons to avoid criminal behaviour, instead of just pulling some extra money out of them as compensation for their continued sociopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

(Sad to change such a vital piece of info, but a user made a brilliant point on how it would be self-contained if it was instantaneous) Edit: 100% infection rate. All of them should have dull intelligence. Their speed, however, is fast. *as in they can run. In the end, they are still vulnerable to wearing down after a year or so. To kill these monsters, it would need a shot to the brain. Under the assumption that it starts with patient zero in a random place across the world, and does not take down a significant part of our population all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all considering that they do not have help from the dragons or other supernatural phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I believe the world would reign victorious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our media is saturated with zombie apocalypse films. It has been an idea so heavily fancied, large portions of the population would already be mentally prepared and know what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if whole countries are torn to the bones by zombies, even if a single country survives it will be able to launch a worthy counterattack. Taking superpowers like the US and Russia, for example, as long as either of them are able to semi-effectively repel the zombies and adapt, the zombies would be fcked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my pet peeves is the portrayal of many militaries in zombie films. From movies that originated from all across the world, the military is somewhat useless. At the end of the day, the main character is usually shown to be even more capable than the military. This is far from the truth. I doubt any zombies could truly wipe out any decent military.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are already contingency plans. This one relates to topic 1 and 3. At this point in time, many people and even governments already know how to deal with the apocalypse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that doesn’t look like it will happen any time soon, I think think more requirements should happen in order for a positive outcome of the prisoners. The system as is does nothing to really keep people out. Recidivism rates are upwards of 40%+ in some states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think… if an individual has continued to work and help make a profit for a company for years, that company should have no issue with the individuals output. Yes, it can be said not having much of a choice and fewer distractions lead to something the person may not do on their own time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think it should be required if good work and behavior are put in, that person is should take precedence and be hired on. The company would also be responsible for halfway housing for up to a set amount of time until their new employee pays rent on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a way that could help lower the recidivism rate and crime. You put someone’s hands to work and they are no longer idle. Then hopefully they relocate the person from people they know. I know some people might want to be around family and friends… but those are probably some of the first people to get you back into the life of crime. Not going back home to them is probably the best and having an easy way elsewhere would be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is very natural for agreeing groups of people to stick together, so just because a couple of thousand people have your back on a subject doesn’t mean the majority of an entire country would agree. Even if a million people were on your side that’s still well under 1% of the US. Stay kind, keep learning, and be open minded, different viewpoints are what drive free countries forward. Don’t let a little support in a group convince you all your views are perfect and right. We all have places to change and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

My view on taxes is this: In order to live in a high functioning society we will have to pay taxes. Like when people want to throw a big barbecue or buy a bunch of alcohol for a party, oftentimes people pitch in money to pay for it all. Obviously this isn&amp;#39;t a great analogy but hopefully you get my drift. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to contribute something in order to gain something. Now I&amp;#39;ll argue all day that taxation has been abused by the government, that&amp;#39;s not even a question at this point. However if you are going to express to me that we&amp;#39;re all being robbed blind by the government by being taxed I&amp;#39;m going to say you&amp;#39;re wrong. When someone steals something from someone they generally don&amp;#39;t intend to give it back. This is not the case with taxes, it&amp;#39;s a thing called tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can start by focusing on two major fundamental flaws in the idea. The first: Everyone is hateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a popular book by a prominent neuroscientist (the title is escaping me at this point, possibly I will edit it in later), that starts off with him describing what he would like to do to Hitler. He talks about wanting to be able to have him alone in a room, tied to a chair, and all the painful things he would be inspired to do to him. And therein lies a big problem, he suggests, because the same mental processes that allow him to justify that cruel treatment of another human being, are the same ones that allowed Nazis to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this will be a point of contention for some, but it is clear to me as a traveler of social media, that often those with radical and passionate ideology on the liberal side of the spectrum, who might be the strongest advocates for hate speech laws, are themselves frequently &lt;em&gt;very hateful people&lt;/em&gt;. And it makes sense: In order to hate, something has to matter to you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychopaths, unless given reasons connected to personal harm, are frequently indifferent to people, and might both not understand why you care so much in a certain situation, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; why you hate so much. A psychopath would not understand why I watch a documentary about conditions in North Korea, and get inspired to march an army in there tomorrow and personally punch Kim Jong-Un in the dick. It is extraordinarily difficult to recognize and overcome these thought processes, which are primally ingrained in us, and it is also not clear and obvious that it is never ever good to have them. Certainly, history shows us that those prone to strict pious notions about such things frequently fail to live up to it, and wind up being hypocrites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, people gonna hate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is this: Speech and dialogue are how we figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speech is how we play with and explore ideas. Frequently we have to be wrong first, and bounce our ideas off of other sources, before we can be right (gee, I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a subreddit devoted to that notion somewhere...). Sometimes we have to go down a path of thought and see where it takes us. Sometimes we have to play devil&amp;#39;s advocate. Sometimes we have to posit open questions to understand how difficult getting clear answers truly is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, it&amp;#39;s only the deepest of fools who thinks, &amp;quot;Nope, no need for that anymore, we&amp;#39;ve got &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answers, and so it is totally appropriate for us just to stop and correct and censor all who don&amp;#39;t concur,&amp;quot; right? Of course humanity is nowhere close to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answers, and perhaps those who think they have them are the ones who most need to be challenged through open speech and expression in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this doesn&amp;#39;t even start to venture into creative and artistic processes. One approach in great literary works in history have taken, is to start with an indefensible idea, and then proceed to do their utmost to defend it. And we certainly all know that literature has to be free to contain immoral or hateful characters, and be free to explore the truth of things without tying it all up in a bow. The novel &lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt; does not preach to you about what a horrible person Patrick Bateman is, it just describes his thoughts and actions, and leaves it to you what to think about it. Vladimir Nabokov does not end &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; with a diatribe about the need to fight child abuse, he simply gives you characters, and let&amp;#39;s you alone to parse the truth in their situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapper Eminem wrote a song about the process of kidnapping and murdering his ex-wife. And that&amp;#39;s hardly only a recent thing - Johnny Cash wrote about killing a man in Reno just to watch him die. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wutPsl41saE&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; track has an old blues singer talking about his intent to cut the letters of the alphabet into his girlfriend&amp;#39;s skin for going out at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even recently thought of how an old Gilbert and Sullivan song could be loosely construed as hate speech. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve Got a Little List&amp;quot; is a song about collections of people in society who &lt;em&gt;no one would miss if they died&lt;/em&gt;. Is that saying it&amp;#39;s good to kill those people? Is it violent in nature, or advocating of violence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, myself, have done some exploring of the dark corners of my brain, and come up with some really dark creative ideas involving hate. The lyrics I come up with are, on their surface, deeply racist, sexist, and maybe just plain insane at times. I very much would love to share these ideas with people on social media, with the intent of what most artistic expression hopes to do: Figure out who we are. If there is honest truth in what I create, then it teaches us something about ourselves, and in doing so, gives us tools for better understanding, and subsequently equips to form a better society. Sounds good, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, but if we allow you to do stuff like that, and all you have to say is that your intent is good, then everyone else can just claim good intent and say whatever they want!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, yes. But the alternative is to use a standard other than intent, and how do we do that? Subjective offense? Banning certain words? Banning certain ideas from being talked about at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what about venting? I&amp;#39;ve often thought about the weird fact that there are subreddits that claim to exist for the primary purpose of venting, like &lt;a href=&quot;/r/offmychest&quot;&gt;r/offmychest&lt;/a&gt;, and yet those subreddits are highly censoring. I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I really wish someone could go on that subreddit and say &amp;quot;I feel like going into a crowd and shooting a bunch of people today&amp;quot; as a way to express their pain and discontentment, get it out of themselves and feel better for it, and maybe even receive compassion and understanding that helps defuse their anti-social thoughts and plug them back into humanity. As opposed to, you know, &lt;em&gt;actually shooting people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, but our hate speech guidelines only include certain things as hate speech, so that makes it okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn&amp;#39;t at all. First of all, it reflects a biased opinion not just about ideas, but which people with which ideas are allowed to be hateful to other people. Second of all, as I suggested, people speak out of emotion sometimes, and need to, and surely we as fellow humans understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But if we don&amp;#39;t have these rules, the evil people we disagree with will take over and chaos will reign!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, I indeed think that&amp;#39;s what the people who most advocate for these rules are most afraid of. And I think it&amp;#39;s a less rational fear than they perceive. I do not agree with the right wing in the USA, but I do believe that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of them are not bad people. I think sometimes people say things to get a rise out of people, or out of anger, or to troll and make the people who annoy them have a conniption. I think the actual number of sinister evil plotters is actually quite tiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the idea that we have to enact extreme measures to protect society is 1. Shared by those on the Right, who are doing their own inappropriate things to counteract the Left, and 2. A common trope of moral panic through history that almost always turns out to be wrong and damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I have already written more than I bet most people will wind up reading, I will digress at this point, and leave it open to counterargument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just want to note that while I indeed think I have a very solid argument here, I know some people strongly disagree, and I am, as always, open to nuance and things I am not considering. So, CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at his tweet he seemed like a madman. The videos he released. Its all just an old,sad and crazy man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,regarding some alleged assasination attempts i couldnt find anything, i doubt a old crazy man could survive multiple attempts at his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the biggest reason why im sure that he killed himself, is the fact that he was about to be moved back to the USA for his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would someone want him dead a few weeks before being faced with his crimes, possibly getting a huge prison sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits would include: Less money spent on housing and feeding inmates, Violent offenders that choose this route would not be able to harm others who have a chance of life on the outside, and while the death penalty would technically still exist, it would be a much more affordable means compared to the current system with it where there are appeals after appeals for every death penalty given out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside that some might mention would be it being inhumane to sentence someone to death. But if that&amp;#39;s what the person wants, why let them live with no hope. If you&amp;#39;re stuck in prison for decades, with no hope of getting out, what&amp;#39;s there to look forward to? What is there to make yourself a better person for? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s no reason for someone to rehabilitate and reform in prison, and they dont want to live in miserable conditions that have been noted in US prisons, with no hope of ever getting out, why not let them take the death penalty instead of possibly suffering a painful death at the hands of themselves or another inmate?

The more heated they become, the bigger the strawman becomes. Maybe this is partially because it is easier to hate this imaginary person than to confront their own ignorance in their arguments and ignorance of their opposition, but it seems like the mind is trying to take an easy out with an uncomfortable situation. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I am often ignorant of certain things in my own arguments, but I try to focus on what I actually disagree with in my opponent&amp;#39;s positions, not fabricate my own reality about invented enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, the next closest justifiable war, Afghanistan, involved killing a terrorist group that had nothing to do with 9/11 and Osama Bin Laden was found hiding in Pakistan, not even in Afghanistan. As for Iraq, it was based on a lie for special interests from the start. Of course there’s nobility in serving ones country and we need a military, but when our military budget is larger than the next 10 countries combined and the US military has killed innocent civilians in every country it’s invaded for the past half century plus, it’s hard to see being in the US military as anything other than being an underpaid mercenary for the benefit of shitty defense companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO CLARIFY, I’M REFERRING TO HOW THE US MILITARY IS AND HAD BEEN FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY, I DON’T DENY THAT A DEFENSIVE MILITARY FORCE IS NECESSARY, BUT THE US MILITARY GOES WAS BEYOND SELF DEFENSE TO EMPIRE DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend 5 minutes on air spewing lies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then spend another 5 minutes in the same time slot apologizing. No small print written retraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made a front page news splash of some nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologize in a front page splash when you issue the retraction.Same font size, page and colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think anything less incentivizes media to print or say whatever crap gets the most views to drive up clicks/sales, because there isn&amp;#39;t any real penalty for not doing so when your retraction won&amp;#39;t be heard by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me be clear I wholeheartedly support the trans community and I want trans people to be accepted and comfortable in all aspects of life including athletic competition. That being said I’m not aware of any comprehensive study that’s shows (specifically trans women) do or do not have a competitive edge in women’s sports. I hope I don’t come off as “transphobic” as that’s what I’m being called, but I don’t have an answer and I do believe there are valid points on both sides of this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
