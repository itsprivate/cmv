&lt;p&gt;All in all, I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that to combat misinformation, just shutting it down at this stage does more harm than good, Reddit has always been a free platform, albeit recently it has changed dramatically and it seems the admins pick and choose who gets silenced, but at the end of the day the people on these subreddits are just going to find another outlet, and push them further into the echo chamber, instead, surely we should just let everyone be, and discuss the issues fairly and critically whenever we can, I would love and welcome a good debate on this, and what exactly shutting these communities down will do in the long run?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I should also mention that important subreddits dedicated to discussing Covid are privating themselves for this exact reason, notably &lt;a href=&quot;/r/CoronavirusUK&quot;&gt;/r/CoronavirusUK&lt;/a&gt; have done this, and I&amp;#39;ve always used that sub to get all the important information I need about the state of the pandemic in my country, surely this is counter-intuitive and does more harm than good when it comes to misinformation??&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m going to write this under the assumption that God doesn&amp;#39;t exist because I think that will resonate with the average Reddit user better though I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think that myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We engage in all sorts of useful fictions just because they make life easier. Like that &amp;quot;everything will turn out fine in the end&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;your vote counts.&amp;quot; These are things we all deep down know aren&amp;#39;t necessarily true but they are necessary lies to keep our society functional. We all know that our individual vote will basically have zero impact but we believe that it will have some because if everyone thought realistically, democracy wouldn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are many situations in which the same logic can be applied to religion. Even if rationally you know you can&amp;#39;t prove a religion to be true, I think in a lot of cases it could still be useful to believe that it is true. While there are many religious groups that spread more hate than love, there are plenty to choose from that do just the opposite. I am not talking about those religions that are hateful in their message, because I don&amp;#39;t believe those are useful beliefs to have. On the Christian front there are organizations like the United Church of Canada who treat homosexual people as equals. Most North American Mahayana Buddhist groups have done away with any sort of discrimination against women or homosexual people as well. Sikh groups also have a tendency towards acceptance. Those are the types of groups I&amp;#39;m saying can be of use to be a part of and believe in. I think people on Reddit tend to forget that there are more religions than evangelical Protestantism, traditional Catholicism, and fundamentalist Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious people are statistically happier and are given a community and something to be a part of. Provided the right one is chosen, religion can encourage people to be more empathetic and loving. Some religious groups even mandate charity. Remember, I am only advocating for participation in religious groups that advocate empathy towards all, what I classify as useful beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if believing in religion causes you to be happier and a better person, then that belief is rational. If you&amp;#39;re a materialist atheist you believe that we only have one chance at this life, is it not rational to spend it in the way that makes you happiest and causes you to increase the happiness of others? I don&amp;#39;t believe in some supreme value of truth above all else, I think sometimes belief in the irrational can be a great benefit. That isn&amp;#39;t to say that truth isn&amp;#39;t very important in many cases, just that sometimes fiction is more useful than truth. I think it&amp;#39;s time to stop asking whether belief in religion is rational, and time to start asking whether it is rational to believe. If we had proof of God, then faith would not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

He clearly loved animals and dedicated his life to protecting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has understandably made him a hero in the eyes of most Redditors. I&amp;#39;m not trying to attack him as a person. He didn&amp;#39;t deserve to get hurt, let alone killed. But I think his death serves as a cautionary tale about messing with wild animals, much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Treadwell&quot;&gt;Timothy Treadwell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew a lot of people working in conservation while Irwin was alive. They were all waiting with dread for the day one of his stunts would kill him. No one expected it to be a stingray - it&amp;#39;s extremely uncommon to be killed by one. But if someone was going to die by stingray, it was going to be the guy who regularly took insane risks with animals - that was the consensus when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently made a comment about this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/pdaaez/of_course_steve_irwin_shreds_in_khaki_should_have/&quot;&gt;a video showing him draping an extremely venomous wild sea snake over his head, with the snake&amp;#39;s head resting on his eyelid&lt;/a&gt;. As I expected, I received a good dose of downvotes. I was told that deaths from stingrays are extremely rare. My counter to that was - if a person takes enough risks (big and small) with wild animals, eventually something will go wrong. Play with fire long enough and you&amp;#39;ll get burnt. I was told that stingray deaths are rare again. That conversation wasn&amp;#39;t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; surprising that it was a stingray that got him. It was more likely that he&amp;#39;d be killed by one of the more dangerous animals he regularly harassed. But anyone who knows wild animals knows that every animal that can defend itself is inherently dangerous - stingrays included. Irwin knew that too. Keep in mind, he wasn&amp;#39;t handling wild animals in a safe way, he was deliberately antagonizing them and taking unnecessary risks to create engaging content (like in the video linked above). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s dig into the stingray thing for a moment. It was a short-tail stingray, which are generally docile. So what made this one attack Irwin? I&amp;#39;ve helped free short-tail stingrays from fishing nets before, and when they feel threatened they&amp;#39;re anything but docile. Another good way to make an animal feel threatened is to sneak up above and behind it. Or to corner it between people. Irwin would have known that too. But, according to Irwin&amp;#39;s cameraman, he did both of those things. And, while threatening the stingray, he positioned himself  in a way that put his exposed chest and abdomen within striking distance. No one should ever be doing that. It would be surprising if it wasn&amp;#39;t consistent with his modus operandi: putting himself in harm&amp;#39;s way to make exciting TV. The cameraman was told to keep filming if he was attacked, no matter how viciously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s say, hypothetically, that he did &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; right in that situation, my original point stands: dealing wild animals is like Russian Roulette. There are a lot of chambers, and you start with only one bullet. When you antagonize an animal, you add more bullets. Even more if they&amp;#39;re usually dangerous, and more again if you get in their space. But you only need one bullet to lose Russian Roulette. And he loaded a lot of bullets that really didn&amp;#39;t need to be there. Over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irwin liked to downplay the danger of wild animals and I think he genuinely believed it to a degree. It&amp;#39;s a dangerous attitude and it&amp;#39;s stupid. Irwin should have known better. But he kept pulling the trigger, and eventually he lost the game. CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sources are the Wikipedia articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Irwin&quot;&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_injury&quot;&gt;stingray injuries&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-tail_stingray&quot;&gt;short-tail stingrays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140310154552/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/steve-irwins-final-words-cameraman-present-at-death-opens-up-about-deadly-stingray-attack-for-the-first-time-9181077.html&quot;&gt;this interview with the cameraman&lt;/a&gt; cited in some of those articles, and many hours of watching &lt;em&gt;The Crocodile Hunter&lt;/em&gt; when I was young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about posting this in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&gt;r/unpopularopinion&lt;/a&gt; but I really want to understand why most people on Reddit seem to disagree with me. It can&amp;#39;t just be that people don&amp;#39;t want to acknowledge the faults of their hero, can it? I love it when something makes me change my mind. Please tell me what I&amp;#39;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Edit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking you to convince me stingray deaths are absurdly rare. I already know.&lt;/strong&gt; I knew how rare they were before I posted this. I knew before he died. I&amp;#39;ve acknowledged it in my post several times, and explained why that argument doesn&amp;#39;t hold much weight. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pey51f/cmv_steve_irwin_regularly_took_stupid_risks_with/hb0skg2?context=3&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve said a bit more about it in this comment&lt;/a&gt;. I have experience with this species that I&amp;#39;m betting few here have ever had. The fact that he was killed by such an unlikely animal only further emphasizes my point about how the risks he took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your point is just some version of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s extremely rare&amp;quot; without at least addressing some of the counterpoints I&amp;#39;ve made, you can&amp;#39;t expect to CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edit 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted what I think it&amp;#39;s a well-written argument that&amp;#39;s generated a significant amount of comments. I feel like I&amp;#39;m being amicable, articulate, and open minded. My views might be wrong, that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here. But it seems people are downvoting this post because they disagree with me. That really doesn&amp;#39;t help CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3. I fixed a typo. The downvotes seem to have slowed right down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no practical difference between, &amp;quot;I really really don&amp;#39;t want to do that&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;God says I don&amp;#39;t have to do that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we as a society deem a rule important enough to make it a law, it should apply to everyone equally, regardless of whether or not they want to follow that law. And if we as a society feel like a proposed rule is not so important that absolutely everyone needs to follow it regardless of how they feel about it, then we should not make that rule into a law at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is most commonly about vaccine hesitancy nowadays, but I think that religious exemptions across the board should be abolished. For example, I used to lifeguard at a pool where there were many patrons that practice Islam. Muslim women would come to the pool wearing ankle length flowing dresses, expecting to be able to swim. I lost track of the number of times that I had to tell them that swimming in a large piece of fabric that can wrap them up and limit their mobility in the water is too unsafe to be allowed, only for them to come back with, &amp;quot;But my religion says I have to wear this.&amp;quot; Well, then your religion also implies that you cannot swim in our pool.  (We did sell modesty swim suits, made of swim suit material, that were ankle length and wrist length, with a head covering. They were specifically designed to be safe to swim in while also covering all skin except hands, feet, and face. Some of the women did not feel like the closer (safer) fit of these modesty suits was modest enough to fit with their religious restrictions.) The rule about not wearing loose, flowy clothing while swimming is a safety rule important enough that everyone needs to follow it without exceptions. If it were determined that it&amp;#39;s not so important that there should be no exceptions, then the rule shouldn&amp;#39;t exist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

I think that if you believe in that statement as an argument for being anti-vaccination that you have to also be pro-choice. There seems to be a large overlap of people who are anti-vax and evangelical (anti-abortion), which got me thinking...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only argument I&amp;#39;ve been able to come up with being against this line of thinking is that abortion effects a 3rd party (the fetus) where as a vaccination only effects the host. My argument would be that when you choose to not get vaccinated you&amp;#39;re choice doesn&amp;#39;t just effect you. Your choice has the potential to effect countless other people around you including death. If you infect someone with something you&amp;#39;re carrying and they die because of it I&amp;#39;d argue that you caused the death of that person. Sure you could argue it&amp;#39;s not a one-to-one thing and there&amp;#39;s a chance that you might not infect anyone, but ultimately it&amp;#39;s a choice you&amp;#39;re making that has the potential to effect a lot of people who didn&amp;#39;t have a choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, I don&amp;#39;t really see how you can be anti-vax and not also pro-choice. Change my view!&lt;/p&gt;

So I am going to split this into 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1. K-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with the current system is that we teach based on age not based on ability. School should have 3 levels for each subject in each grade. Behind, normal and advanced. Each level should have tests that place a child and allow them to move up at ANY TIME. They should be able to request a test at any time, and all courses should have an online option for those who move faster then the class. If a child is able to test out of their grade they should imminently move up to the next level. Once they are done with all 12 (13) grades they are done with school and can go on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2. Higher education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher education aka college/university is a terrible system, there are about 3 careers that I would say need University and that is Lawyers, Doctors, and Educators. Because those require a lot of text book learning that can&amp;#39;t be left to individual companies to teach. Other then that, everything else should be taught by the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies and industries not only should teach their prospective employees though academies or training but they have an incentive to. If people have to go to no cost training/academies for employment you are much more likely to keep the employees you hire for their whole career since switching will be more time then its worth and they will start at a younger age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3. At Will Employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At will employment is one of the biggest frauds committed against the American people ever. In 49 out of 50 states Employment at Will is the law. That means that a company can hire you and fire you for any reason (that is not protected) and you can quit for any reason at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire at will, fire at will, quit at will sounds nice right? Nope that means...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On call 24/7 oh it says you only have to work for specific hours and yes you do get over time, however if you refuse then they can fire you and you can&amp;#39;t do anything because fire at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagnant wages there is no incentive to give you a raise or hell even keep your pay the same because since you aren&amp;#39;t contract they can just fire you and no even give a reason and then hire a different person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No reason fires you effectively don&amp;#39;t have any rights because they simply just have to make up a reason or say nothing at all and you are gone, try going to HR because of inappropriate or intentional bad behavior meant to try to get you to quit or just take advantage they can say bye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration the bullshit that removes the courts, that any private sector employee likely signed because of course they can force you to give it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the law required contracts for employment that would mean that you could only get fired for either directly breaking code of conduct or failure to do your job correctly, and that you would have due process before being fired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they fire you for a dumb reason then you get damages, if the employee quits before term is they pay penalties. Basically the way the public sector works. Better pay/benefits (might be slightly lower pay but you get real benefits and pensions) Most have 20-25 year retirement with 60+% of your monthly way pension then you get Social Security check later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending at will employment is what must happen for labor standards to go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit- Retirement savings plan is not a pension, a pension is no cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ll try to explain by using a concrete example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commonly used way of saying stuff is &amp;quot;Get GAME on PLATFORM&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get Transport Fever 2 on GOG Galaxy&amp;quot; means I can get the game and play it forever, because GOG doesn&amp;#39;t apply DRM, so after the game is on your computer they have no control on what you do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get Transport Fever 2 on Steam&amp;quot; means I can get a license to play the game and play it as long as my Steam account is valid, I&amp;#39;m not VAC banned, etc etc etc.
Getting the game on GOG Galaxy means getting it forever, getting the game on Steam has the possibility that at one point I won&amp;#39;t be able to play it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, Steam saying &amp;quot;Get Transport Fever 2 on Steam&amp;quot; should be illegal (perhaps false advertising), because it could imply permanence (like in the case of GOG), even though the EULA doesn&amp;#39;t give that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is going more and more towards renting stuff rather than owning it, and it is doing so in a misleading way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I think that laws should be put in place such that &amp;quot;buying&amp;quot; something can only be used if, after the purchase, that &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;, with all the advertised features, can be used indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take the example of the PlayStation 4. After buying the PS4, you can use the hardware forever. You can also play games you have on CD forever. However, you cannot play multiplayer games forever (if PSN goes away so goes multiplayer), and if your PlayStation account is banned (for example if you make a chargeback), you also lose all digital games you bought from the PlayStation Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, if Sony wants to advertise the PS4 as something you can buy, it should be illegal to make any reference to the ability to play games multiplayer, play digital games, or download stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it should be illegal for Sony to say that games obtained through the PlayStation Store can be &amp;quot;bought&amp;quot; or that they &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; those games. Instead, Sony should only be allowed to say that you can rent those games through the PS Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems unfair for Sony to be able to permanently erase all your games you bought online if you chargeback a fraudulent payment. Since the chance of preventing that is low, and since that&amp;#39;s not the only issue (once Sony shuts down the PlayStation Store for an old console, all online games are gone too), the distinction between something you buy and keep and something you rent and &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; disappear at one point should be clearly advertised to consumers so they are at least informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just a Sony/PlayStation rant, but the easiest example and first that came to mind. Internet of Things (smart home) stuff is famously becoming paperweight if the company decides to no longer support the product, for example. As such, it seems unfair to advertise features that may be gone anytime as features of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I understand that products don&amp;#39;t last forever. For example, the PlayStation 4 or a smart lightbulb might break. However, in these situations, the lifetime of a product is longer than the guaranteed lifetime of stuff that should be labeled as &amp;quot;rented&amp;quot;. If my PS4 breaks, &lt;em&gt;c&amp;#39;est la vie&lt;/em&gt;, I can&amp;#39;t play games anymore, that&amp;#39;s to be expected. But if I &lt;strong&gt;buy&lt;/strong&gt; a game from PlayStation Store, I expect to be able to play it until my PS4 breaks, not until tomorrow (which is when Sony might arbitrarily decide to ban my PSN account and invalidate all my purchases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I don&amp;#39;t agree that pointing it out in the EULA is even remotely enough. &lt;em&gt;(In an unrelated note, I don&amp;#39;t think EULAs should be enforceable or legally binding if a company can&amp;#39;t prove the user properly read &lt;strong&gt;and understood&lt;/strong&gt; it. This particular opinion is mostly unrelated to the rest of this post, however, and even if you don&amp;#39;t agree with this last opinion, my point in the rest of this post still stands.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC, ABC, Al-Jazeera, and others, all have female lead reporters on the ground who are trying to interview Taliban leaders for critical information, and oftentimes the interview (with the goal of &lt;em&gt;getting critical information&lt;/em&gt;) ends up accomplishing nothing at all because the Taliban don&amp;#39;t respect them. Here is an example I saw this morning on Al Jazeera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RiYAmfb.png&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I asked for information about the situation at the airport, and they refused to talk to me because I was a women and not dressed appropriately&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to you on camera. What did you expect? &lt;strong&gt;The Taliban don&amp;#39;t respect women.&lt;/strong&gt; We all know that. We all know that is wrong and bigoted. We have known that for decades, so why self sabotage an important information gathering activity by purposefully antagonizing the people you are trying to interview?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be like sending a blind reporter to give an eye witness report for a newspaper. Or sending a deaf person to review a new music album. Or sending an Amish person who doesn&amp;#39;t use electricity to an press conference about new computer chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just isn&amp;#39;t the right person to send for this one particular activity.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s like religious people have to completely shut down their brains to continue believing at this point which is nearly identical to a cult. Religion meets the definition of a cult by every definition I can find. Just because the majority people are in some cult doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not a cult. &amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s funny how the right religion is always the one you grew up with. &amp;quot; That is such a true statement I really don&amp;#39;t see how anyone can believe knowing all that without being mentally delusional. Truthfully religion seems like a very primitive practice that makes very little sense in modern society and should be classified as a delusion or a mental disorder in the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man raises child&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discovers woman cheated, lied about paternity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man asks what to do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit Hivemind says he should remain in the child&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time, no concerns about what the men must now feel about the child, often the fruit of the infidelity he only recently discovered, but that if he stops caring for said child, he is no longer a &amp;quot;Real Man. It is never said in those words, but that&amp;#39;s the feeling from it, some even saying things like a man should castrate himself if he can&amp;#39;t be a father to a child that isn&amp;#39;t his or if he leaves partway through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&amp;#39;t a guy be able to leave? He did nothing wrong, the child isn&amp;#39;t his concern, or at least shouldn&amp;#39;t be if he no longer wishes to do so. That child has a chance to be raises by their real bio-dad or by someone else. But it has to be him, the betrayed, who MUST stay, or at least continue to be in the child&amp;#39;s life.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, the child themselves didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong, but that child is still a picture of the hurt, the pain, the cheating, the lies. But, he should swallow all of that because the child might grow up without him there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any other kind of relationship, this isn&amp;#39;t expected. If you are married to someone for ten years, then get ill and you find out that they cheated, maybe even that this illness is the reason of them cheating, you can and should still be able to leave that marriage, because why should you be tied to an agreement they didn&amp;#39;t keep? If you worked in a business that was supposed to be yours, but you find out that it wasn&amp;#39;t that it legally belongs to someone else, why on Earth should you be forced to stay, otherwise, you really didn&amp;#39;t care for the business?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should the time that passed matter? Why shouldn&amp;#39;t your next move be fore you and you alone? Why is it ok to tell a man that if he doesn&amp;#39;t care for the child that isn&amp;#39;t his, that he never really loved the child or that there is something wrong with him?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I seeing this issue wrong somehow? Change my Views on this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize &amp;quot;Do they just care about their own subreddit and nothing else?&amp;quot; was such a stupid question. But I agree now... it is... modding their own sub is all a mod typically cares about when modding their own sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point (Ancient Greece? Idk), we realized that not every single person needs to know every single thing. We can &lt;em&gt;specialize&lt;/em&gt; and have jobs in a particular space of knowledge, if we don&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;do our own research&amp;#39; and trust that the society will mitigate our other risks. This specialization of skills/knowledge gives rise to economy, social class, professional subcultures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short, limited example, the farmer doesn&amp;#39;t need to know how to or actually build or repair their own house. The builder doesn&amp;#39;t need to know how to or actually farm crops. They will exchange their services to each other to mitigate each other&amp;#39;s risk, allowing each of them to become better at their specialization. When you scale this example, you see how you now need an economy to be able to efficiently exchange work between mediums. It gives rise to social class as the ones with the most utility (doctor&amp;#39;s, politicians, judges, etc.) can curry the most favour in exchange for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: We see this property being leveraged across multiple facets of nature (biological sex, multicellular organisms). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, society progressed much faster when we were able to centralize meaningfully differentiated skills and knowledge. Of course this does not mean that this system is immune to the typical challenges of centralization (lack of transparency, trust, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I hear &amp;#39;do your own research&amp;#39;, my brain translates it to &amp;#39;There is a significant enough risk that this centralized knowledge/skill base is compromised, that I need to mitigate the primary risk myself&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a fair thing to say, and act on for a lot of contexts (ie. Journalism/media on political events), but the implication above for such key systems such as healthcare or engineering, is the equivalent of basically trying to mitigate the risk of a total societal collapse/revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is antithetical to, imo, one of the core reasons for society&amp;#39;s success and state today.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ll use myself as an example to start. I&amp;#39;m Lumbee Indian (card-carrying), and thus college is free for me from many instutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue arises from the fact that I don&amp;#39;t live in Robeson County, North Carolina, where much of my family does, and where the Lumbee tend to be poorer than white people, on average. I live in Minnesota, am moderately well-off, and have never faced racial discrimination, (mostly because my dad is white and I got his genes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still get free college, despite my grades being average at best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I believe that college admissions shouldn&amp;#39;t look at you&amp;#39;re race, but at the wealth of your family. Race doesn&amp;#39;t generally cause people to get poor grades and test scores, but the wealth of their parents can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A white kid with a single mother who works as a janitor, but has a 3.8 GOA and a 30 on the ACT would be more qualified for university than Malia Obama, if she had the same numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race can be a factor, but it isn&amp;#39;t always a factor, and colleges should recognize that.&lt;/p&gt;

A man has no choice, after conception whether or not he wants to he could be made a father. My view is that if the man makes it clear to the woman that he does not want this baby (with ample time for the woman to consider her options) then he should not be forced to support the child. I think morally this should be a very black and white issue, if women can choose to be or not to be a parent after conception so should men.

&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes exist on planet earth, simply to be parasites and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/outdoor/mosquito-borne/default.html&quot;&gt;spread disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re talking things like West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, Malaria. Diseases that have life altering consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried reading the arguments of why they should exist: they feed bats and birds, they keep humans out of sensitive natural environments like the rainforests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But humans are going into the rainforests anyway and chopping them down, so not much of a deterrent if you ask me. And surely there’s enough OTHER kinds of bugs that could feed bats and birds. I’d like for them to eat more spiders please.&lt;/p&gt;

You should know whether or not you can handle being friends with someone who rejected you, or whether or not you can handle separating from them entirely if need be. If you’re unsure, err on the side of caution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have issue with people who understand the risks and decide to move forward anyway, I have issue with the people who do it, get rejected, and ostentatiously whine about it afterward because they’ve been put in the accursed “friendzone.” If it bothers you so much, why not be straightforward and tell them you need to break away from their friendship for some time (maybe even forever) instead of hiding behind an awkward mask while continuing to stick by their side with feelings you haven’t dealt with? Or better yet, do some self-reflection, grow up, and understand that your love for them is a testament to your enjoyment of their company, therefore you should be content with having at least their friendship. Don’t ruin a good platonic relationship by thinking it’s the end of the world to be put in the friendzone. The friendzone is a beautiful place, and if you give it a chance you’ll come to understand that it’s worth the temporary pain you get from rejection. Being friends is more important than (the idea of) being lovers, at least if you truly care about that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pies, jams, smoothies, muffins and more, I can&amp;#39;t think of a single berry with more uses than the humble blueberry. Strawberries do have the advantage of making a sick ice cream but when&amp;#39;s the last time you saw a strawberry muffin? I thought not. I suppose cranberry juice is pretty nice but I think blueberry smoothies offset that too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some berries like strawberries require removing a green thing before they&amp;#39;re eaten and pretty much need to be cut up. Blueberries just need a quick rinse before they can be chomped down upon. Wanna eat just one blueberry? Have a quick, tiny snack! Wanna ingest a giant spoonful of blue and round goodness? Enjoy that as well! Blueberries work great with both a fork and a spoon too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best bush&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raspberry bushes are covered in spikes and are very scary in general. 0/5, not family friendly at all, my kids were very scared. Blueberry bushes, on the other hand, are inviting, gentle creatures. They are a bit more of a pain to take care of (I accidentally mowed a part of a baby one, oops), but I think the benefits make it well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna sit here and pretend that blueberries are the cheapest berry, they aren&amp;#39;t. But is that really what we should be looking at when it comes to price? A GT 1030 is cheap, but does that make it the best graphics card? Of course not. What really matters is price to performance, and on that front I don&amp;#39;t think you can fault the blueberry even slightly. Sure, it might cost a bit more per calorie but given all the aforementioned uses for the blueberry I think it&amp;#39;s well worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I think has been thoroughly demonstrated, the blueberry is the berry to reign superior over all other berries. I look forward to seeing what others have to say on the matter...&lt;/p&gt;

I believe this kind of things encourages employees and customers to act in ways that are damaging to the business and that these  negative behaviors could be reduced if bonuses/quotas were instead calculated on a trailing rolling basis. So for example, in the above example you would get a daily bonus calculated by the formula: (Average cars sold per day for past 30 days - target cars sold per day)*$500. Yes, this is slightly more complicated, but in the days of automated tracking the added complexity is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By going to this system, it would stop the employee from doing things like offering price discounts, etc. in order to game the numbers in an arbitrary accounting period provided the commission they lost from being negotiable on price was less than their volume bonus. It might also cause an employee to try to shift sales in to a later month if they were below the bonus quota (so they would have a better chance of making bonus next month) and risk losing the deal as a result of the delay. Furthermore, if customers knew they no longer could get pricing power by coming in on the last day of the month/year, they would stop trying and stop expecting a discount from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have personally seen time and again, companies and individuals making horrible business decisions because they want to close deals or achieve certain goals within an arbitrary accounting period. Employees sloppily finishing a project by an arbitrary deadline, or cutting scope out of a job so they can book/complete it by a certain date. I once literally saw a team in my company find a BS reason to cut $30M of scope out of a job so they could get the contract signed by the end of the bonus period. Every time I see this, I think to myself that this most of this could be fixed by just having incentive structures that was based on trailing averages and not based arbitrary hard deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I acknowledge that the reason for using arbitrary accounting periods is also because reporting periods for public companies are also based on arbitrary periods, I feel that this is circular reasoning. If companies moved away from arbitrary accounting periods to using better thought out incentive periods, so might their investors take a longer view at financial results. I would also say that only a tiny fraction of companies are publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter crack: I get a flattening of the round surface, maybe it goes concave instead of convex, with some spider-web cracks emanating from the point of impact. I still have to pierce the egg with my thumb, usually making contact with the white. Often the membrane underneath the shell is still intact.

At that point I can turn the egg so the break is at the top, letting the white move down so that I touch little or no white when I complete the crack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yea I absolutely do not believe in that. I’m referring to all kinds of parents. Children aren’t obligated to take care of them in old age. 
Even if you  did a good job as a parent and treat your children well, your children aren’t obligated to take care of you. Parents decide to bring children into this world, they have no say in this, so if they choose to not take care of you when you are older, then you can’t blame them. &lt;/p&gt;

This is demonstrated time and time again within subreddits such as sino, which argues/believes tianmen massacre never happened. This is arguably dangerous as well as it gives them more ammo again the USA being against China and creating lies to hurt them. While I completely disagree with antivaxxers and think vaccines are both safe and important, just like any social media there will be people who disagree with you. The information they post is no different to Facebook or Instagram or even tiktok. Is Reddit allowing them to broadcast it more? Of course, but Reddit is not exactly breeding this misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The misinformation is killing people but that is not the fault of Reddit. It is the fault of those who choose to believe it despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that proves what they fear most; the vaccine is effective and safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Reddit does step in and remove these subreddits they are only beginning the process of converting Reddit into an echo chamber/circle jerk social media. It is not nor should it be Reddit’s responsibility to protect antivaxxers from their own information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand this is a controversial take but I struggle with understanding why some subreddits with blatant and somewhat harmful misinformation are allowed to stay and other subreddits cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relationships often take the form of celebrity worship or extreme fandom, wherein a person will become obsessed with a public figure to an unhealthy degree. This causes them to neglect and eventually completely ignore other aspects of their lives, especially their social lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the OnlyFans messaging &amp;quot;services&amp;quot; are the worst form of parasocial relationships. It takes men who are already clearly suffering from extreme loneliness and sexlessness and sells them a bizarre fantasy wherein they have a &amp;quot;girlfriend experience&amp;quot; which is completely hollow and disingenuous. This causes them not only to neglect their relationships with people face to face, but it intertwines complex and deep-rooted feelings of loneliness and desire for love and sex. I imagine it&amp;#39;s a delicate &amp;quot;carrot and stick&amp;quot; dynamic where the idea of the girl actually caring about the subscriber must be dangled just out of reach in a perpetual manner in order to keep the money coming in. This is extremely destructive and this practice should be shamed in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#39;s also bad when this happens digitally on Twitch, or in any other context. But at least in this case the relationship is more distant and clearly less &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot;, since there are dozens or even hundreds of other lonely men who are vying for a girl&amp;#39;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#39;s also bad when &amp;quot;sex workers&amp;quot; offer this service in reality, face to face - but at least it&amp;#39;s face to face. In that sense the men might at least incidentally pick up some social skills, even if the interaction is completely artificial. The digital, text-based aspect of the Onlyfans messaging services is about as distant as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/mazkok/onlyfans_girls_arent_personally_messaging_you/&quot;&gt;hard to confirm&lt;/a&gt;, but there&amp;#39;s also the idea that some of the users who offer these services &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/some-influencers-have-ghostwriters-to-respond-to-onlyfan-messages-2020-12&quot;&gt;aren&amp;#39;t even the ones the subscribers are talking to&lt;/a&gt;. They may be outsourcing/delegating this service to others, probably men. I can&amp;#39;t imagine what kind of intense psychological break might occur if one of these subscribers learned that this was going on. Can you imagine? They might even do &lt;em&gt;something really stupid&lt;/em&gt; in a fit of rage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this post because I strangely never hear talk about this aspect of Onlyfans &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot;, which in my opinion is the most harmful. But maybe there&amp;#39;s a reason others don&amp;#39;t seem very concerned about it. Change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

I think this sort of fee should be banned as a bait and switch tactic, and any mandatory fee whatsoever should be built into all advertised prices. I am thinking of this along the lines of airline price regulations in the US, which require that advertised fares include all taxes and fees that are mandatory to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the fee is optional, then I think it&amp;#39;s fine to not include it in the price, much like a checked bag fee is not included in advertised prices. But a mandatory fee is just an increased room rate, and advertising a rate at a hotel of $X, when in fact the rate is $X+40 is just false advertising and should be banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is not a pure democracy but it is democratizing more over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most Western countries are relatively new to democracy as we know it today compared to the size of human history. Democracy as a concept was considered very early on. Historically, throughout much of human history it was treated with disdain because of the unrealibility of the averge voter. Aristotle for example thought that a better alternative would be an enlightened monarch or an enlightened aristocracy purely focused on studying and governing to improve the nation--I don&amp;#39;t prescribe to this view necessarily, this is an example of people&amp;#39;s views on democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

They created ISIS and fund the terrorist group. Saudi Money funds the Islamic state, Saudi citizens fight for them in mass, and the Wahhabism government turns a blind eye because their ideology is almost identical to ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we can claim to be against terrorism yet economically and militarily support the most religiously radical state in the world is sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of punishments that Saudi Arabia and ISIS use. Lets see if you can tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by death- Blasphemy, Acts of Homosexuality, Treason, and Murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Following is punishable by an undetermined number of lashes- Slander and Drinking Alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by death by stoning - Adulatory if married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by 100 lashes- Adulatory if unmarried&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by cutting off ones right hand- Stealing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by cutting off one foot and one hand- Banditry theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by death- Banditry murder and theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by death- Blasphemy, Acts of Homosexuality, Treason, and Murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Following is punishable by 80 lashes- Slander and Drinking Alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by death by stoning - Adulatory if married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by 100 lashes and exile for a year- Adulatory if unmarried&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by cutting off one hand- Stealing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by cutting off one foot and one hand- Banditry theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is punishable by crucifixion- Banditry murder and theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am leaving the name of which one is ISIS and which one is Saudi Arabia to make a point. Both are barbaric, murderous groups the only difference is one took over a state and got legitimately recognized. Removing all support from Saudi Arabia ends a lot of Terrorism because the money source would be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

They don&amp;#39;t teach inclusivity cause several races are left out from the equation and also thinner/normal body types. 
They help glorify sex work  in an ill way and encourage it, which is degrading and has several mental effect on women and men of all ages.
They push women to be slutty to feel empowered confusing the two concepts and push men to be too masculine and to view women as objects and to not respect them. Also don&amp;#39;t get me started on the body dysmorphia.
Also reaserch show that seeing your friends always posting their best self on social media and comparing yourself to them makes u depressed and unsatisfied with your life, and no, the &amp;quot;remember social media is fake&amp;quot; trend is like pissing into a fire  trying to estinguish it, it does t solve the problem. 
the only thing they&amp;#39;re good is to keep in touch with poeple but the posting part is totally useless and it&amp;#39;s just a way to get validation for a generation that is willing to do the dumbest shit to get it. 
Also tik tok should be canceled. It is basically a p*do/horny guys/creeps dream come true where they can see underage girls dressing and acting in revealing &amp;quot;clothes &amp;quot;  desperate for likes but they don&amp;#39;t know where they come from. Also it is a Chinese company that doesn&amp;#39;t give a shut about your privacy just saying... 
They are also the worst source to get information from cause 90 percent of the time reaserch and statistics is manipulated or not cited(like this post lol) and fake news are spread like crazy 
Hope someone will change my point of view since I have the sin to still using them daily and I need to feel good about myself even tho we all know  these things.&lt;/p&gt;

Anytime a woman says she prefers or will only date 6’0+ men, short men will get pissed and act like she’s the biggest bitch in the world (which is an obvious projection of their insecurities). If you’re not attracted to men below 6’0, then you shouldn’t have to date them, the same way a man shouldn’t have to date an obese woman if he doesn’t find her attractive. People can have whatever preference they want, even if it’s ridiculous, as long as you aren’t shallow towards people who don’t fit your preference. It’s not just easy to “look past it” and find other things thst make up for it, it’s ok to have things you’re solely attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;

Both are amazing and bring different aspects to music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studio albums provide highly polished and produced versions of songs, which is great. If a band whats to use effects or have members playing multiple instruments it allows them to do so. This is good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live shows can provide an amazing atmosphere and performance, at their best creating an almost religious experience for those attending, as well as bonding experiences for friends going together. This is also most excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, my issue is that with an album of a live recording, you lose what is best about both. Getting neither the production quality of studio albums, nor the raw experience of being at a mindblowing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can kind of understand having a recording of a gig you went to, for posterity&amp;#39;s sake, but even then, it isn&amp;#39;t going to match the experience of actually &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; there. There is perhaps an accessibility argument, but even then, I&amp;#39;d suggest watching a video of the gig, to get the full AV show, instead of just an audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d have to write this, but can you explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a certain recording of a live show is not worse than either seeing it live or a studio version, instead of just listing your favourite recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2&lt;/strong&gt;: After a few responses, I&amp;#39;ve hit on the crux of this CMV; &amp;quot;what does a live recording bring that neither IRL gigs or studio albums do?&amp;quot;. Answer that, and I&amp;#39;ll be putty in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising, given how the US system is basically throw them in a shithole, treat them like shit and slaves, force them to disclose the fact that they&amp;#39;re a felon on job applications, then going all suprised pikachu face when they can&amp;#39;t find employment and turn back to crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

How can a man have a role in a field requiring care for children if he is not trusted with children’s basic care? Fathers often change diapers, help children use the toilet, and put children down for naps. And maybe that’s what distinguishes early childhood education from other female-dominated professions. Declaring men unfit to provide such care is not only about sexism against men, it’s also about sexism against women. The greater the fear of men in caring professions, the more women are left to shoulder the responsibility of care work. If women experienced equality in all professions, then perhaps they wouldn’t regard child care as their exclusive domain, and wouldn’t feel threatened by the participation of men. How can we teach U.S. children not to regard early childhood education as the exclusive domain of women, when they see only women caring for them? What message are we sending today’s youth when we glorify involved fathers and stay-at-home dads but vilify male child-care workers? We should encourage more men to enter this field, and celebrate them rather than fear them.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that this seems like evil profiteering by Blackwater, and maybe it is, but the truth is the world is a better place for them doing this. They are not going to do it for free, and this way more people who want to leave, can. If Blackwater did not evacuate these people, some of them will end up stuck and some of them will even end up on free flights, taking the seat of others. Who is worse off for Blackwater doing this? The constraint on evacuations is a lack of planes, not a lack of runway time (to be clear, some flights did have to divert, but it was because no one could land because refugees had taken over the runways). Blackwater is solving that problem, albeit it a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Several commenters have made great points that ultimately boil down to how one defines &amp;quot;good,&amp;quot; which is a very nebulous concept. So let me briefly define good as I used it in my title: Good is the absence of bad. We should stop people from doing bad things. We should not stop Blackwater from evacuating people for a price, so long as the constraint on evacuations is planes and not runway time. Blackwater is doing a good thing under my (admittedly binary) definition of good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

The state is capable of wielding enormous power and influence in public and private lives of citizens. The separation between church and state is to protect each body from the other. The state should not be able to reach into the church and dictate except in extreme cases. Similarly, the church isn’t the government. It doesn’t have the same writ as the government and shouldn’t be allowed to reach into the government or lives of non-followers—ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I believe decisions based on religion (especially the predominate monotheist versions) are invalid in discourse over public policy comes down to consent and feedback mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every citizen* has access to the franchise and is subject to the government. The government draws its authority from the governed and there are ways to participate, have your voice heard, change policy, and be represented. Jaded as some may be there are mechanisms in place to question, challenge, and influence policy in the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every citizen follows a religion—further, not even all the followers in America are of the same religion, sect, or denomination. Even IF there was a majority bloc of believers, that is a choice to follow an organization based on faith which demands obedience and eschews feedback/reform. The rules and proclamations are not democratically decided; they are derived, divined, and interpreted by a very small group which does not take requests from the congregation. Which is fine if you’re allowing that to govern your own life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguments about public policy must allow conversation, debate, introduction of objective facts, challenges to authority, accountability of everyone (top to bottom), and evolution/growth/change with introduction and consideration of new information—all things which theist organizations don’t seem to prioritize. Public policy must be defensible with sound logic and reason. Public policy cannot be allowed to be made on the premise of faith or built upon a foundation of a belief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from leaving the country, we do not have a choice in being subject to the government. Following a faith is a choice. If the government is going to limit my actions, I have few options but to comply and if I disagree then exercise rights. If a church is going to limit my actions and I do not agree, then I can walk away. The church can not be allowed to make rules for those outside the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When defending a position on public policy, any defense which falls back on faith, conforming to a religion, or other religious dogma is invalid. If you cannot point to anything more tangible than your own choice in faith or what some parson or clergy dictates, then it should not apply to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any form of, “the law should be X because my faith believes X” is nothing more than forcing your faith on others. CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Yes, I’m aware of people under 18, felons, and others denied the right to vote. That isn’t the scope of this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if all countries committed or have been apart of a genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these people were capable of completely erasing a civilization, they would. The lack of the killer&amp;#39;s capabilities, supplies, and logistics are the ONLY reasons that some aren&amp;#39;t completely destroyed. It&amp;#39;s because they literally can&amp;#39;t sustain or prolong it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, numbers and speed can be devastatingly different, but in my opinion, the &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; of genocide is completely disgusting, evil, hateful, gross, and so much more. You can&amp;#39;t compare one to another.&lt;/p&gt;

The true original definition before COVID ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that we&amp;#39;re past the point of censoring the outspoken to unknown platforms, because they are now everywhere. It&amp;#39;s not just reddit, or Facebook, or Twitter. It&amp;#39;s Instagram and NextDoor and I saw it in descriptions and feedback on Airbnb. It is now everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think various people dropped the ball. I think that it was very unwise of various politicians and news companies to &amp;quot;raise a concern about the vaccine being rushed to help Trump&amp;quot;, and I think that it was unwise for platforms like reddit and Facebook not to foresee this exact thing happening and nipping it in the bud when it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, your next door neighbor heard something about something, and more people than ever have become truly &amp;quot;vaccine hesitant&amp;quot;. Not just COVID vaccines; all vaccines. The same people I was trying so hard to understand before all of this happened, are now all around me eager to share their thoughts, even in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at this point, the only way out is to combat the misinformation, not pretend it doesn&amp;#39;t exist. Reddit and other platforms can ban subreddits, but it&amp;#39;s been complicit in letting it get here, and I don&amp;#39;t think there are too many people left who have no opinion at all. A true crowd-sourced campaign to explain why misinformation is misinformation, including in the communities that are anti-authority--which really, these communities are--is the only way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply banning them and assuming that they&amp;#39;ll at least go elsewhere is helping the rest of the reddit community feel good about ourselves, but addresses no issues, makes no strides forward to change the narrative, and may even hinder the potential progress. Everyone has heard of the COVID vaccines. Some people are hesitant. Removing any platforms that say anything but positive views, will drive them toward more &amp;quot;research&amp;quot; that will create more hardcore antivaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;

Also I&amp;#39;d like to point out that I&amp;#39;d like nothing more than to be convinced here that my view is wrong, because I want to be more hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The View:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the opinion of most experts on the matter that we&amp;#39;re heading towards a serious climate disaster if we do nothing to reverse certain trends. Essentially we&amp;#39;re releasing too much carbon and methane from our industrialization/food production/garment industry/etc. and are causing a serious warming trend, more extreme weather and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those same experts tend to agree that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; things we can still do to avert disaster, but in general they seem to me like fairly major changes for most (or at least some) people. For instance, meat production results in a lot of methane emission, which is a worse greenhouse gas than CO2, so if everyone were vegetarian that could be a big help. Also there&amp;#39;s plenty of talk about basically planting a billion trees to store the carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere. I don&amp;#39;t know &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the big-picture solutions, nor how much a person&amp;#39;s day-to-day impacts the bigger picture, but it does seem that there are things we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pandemic has shown us that there&amp;#39;s a segment of the population that are unwilling to do even something &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;obviously helpful&lt;/em&gt;, such as wear a mask during a pandemic, or maintain social distancing. I know there&amp;#39;s definitely a loud minority making this segment seem probably larger than it is, but basically my takeaway from it has been that even if you give people something fairly small to do to avert an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;obviously real and serious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; risk (Covid), there will still be people who play the &amp;quot;personal freedom&amp;quot; card or science-denial, or some combination of them. So essentially, if you try to get a very large subset of the population to do something &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;even more major&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and to avert a crisis that&amp;#39;s a bit more invisible (i.e. there&amp;#39;s still doubt in the minds of many people that they should or even can do anything to avert the climate disaster) I am of the belief that it&amp;#39;s unreasonable to expect that it would happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve broken this down into the three distinct points that I feel comprise the whole view as I recognize that any part of the three could have logical holes or problems, or even my notion that they follow in this progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I&amp;#39;d really love to turn out to be wrong on this one, so let&amp;#39;s have a discussion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After posting, I realized that of course there&amp;#39;s more to the climate disaster beyond just the actions of us as individuals. However, I feel that it is a separate discussion to dive into the &amp;quot;who&amp;#39;s at fault&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;corporations vs. individuals&amp;quot; and all of that. My view here is more about individuals and modifying their behavior as individuals. If you feel corporations are more to blame, then I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; blame the individuals who have voted (or not voted) and led to the power and size of our largest corporations who are doing most of the damage. It&amp;#39;s still about people and their choices as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;

As Reddit has shown us over the past decade+, content which receives far more upvotes than downvotes moves up in the algorithm&amp;#39;s ranking and is more likely to be seen. Additionally, from a psychosocial standpoint, humans &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be viewed as agreeable, and tend towards views and behavior that the masses consider good. On reddit this often leads to a positive feedback loop, where highly-upvoted content receives even more upvotes because, well, it&amp;#39;s already been upvoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the aforementioned platforms only have positive reactions for posts and comments (outside of Facebook which has angry/laugh reactions) there&amp;#39;s no true way for a person to tell the relative popularity of a person&amp;#39;s post. This means content that only a small minority of people agree with can end up looking very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my opinion that beliefs which are truly on the fringe, or at least used to be - such as anti-vaccine or anti-mask - appear more socially acceptable than they really are, and leads people down that path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;m not saying:&lt;/strong&gt; The content ranking algorithm on platforms which feature a downvote button, such as Reddit, are &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot;.

Let me get this out of the way: I consider myself a feminist (I&amp;#39;m using this term to mean a supporter of the idea that women should &amp;#39;have the same rights and opportunities as men&amp;#39; as per the Oxford dictionary).  HOWEVER, I much prefer to use the term Gender-Egalitarianism because I think it&amp;#39;s a title that better represents feminism&amp;#39;s central message and thus better promotes the movement&amp;#39;s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I see often on the Internet (and sometimes in real life too) is people being reluctant to identify as a feminist because they see feminism as being about getting more things (rights, freedoms, opportunities, political power, etc.) for women FULL STOP.  What I mean by this is, they see feminism as being about lifting up women, with little to no regard to how this leaves men off at the end of the day.  Now, true feminism of course rejects this and takes the issues that disproportionately affect men (like being far less likely to receive custody of their children in divorce, for example) as real problems that need to be solved if men and women are going to be equal in society (of course, this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that a feminist needs to say that men and women have it equally hard, as long as a feminist is willing to admit that both &amp;#39;female&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;male&amp;#39; issues are legitimate issues and deserve addressing, then they&amp;#39;re free to think whatever they want about the current balance of hardship between the sexes).  SO, because feminism is looked at by many people as a women&amp;#39;s power movement, rather than a movement about achieving equality with respect to gender/sex, there a great number of people who have negative connotations with the term feminism, and are far less likely to hear out feminist thinkers/arguments with an open mind.  The is evidenced by the fact that (and I don&amp;#39;t have the stat to point to but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard to find) that the discrepancy between people who believe the sexes should be equal and people who self-identify as feminists is massive in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO, in order to get more people in a state where they can hear the feminist message with an open mind, we need to ditch the (frankly) shitty name &amp;#39;Feminism&amp;#39;.  It simply does not reflect its core message as well as Gender-Egalitarianism does, and this is costing the movement its ability to be heard out by many potential allies.  Imagine if Racial-Egalitarianism (the idea that the races should have the same rights and opportunities) was called &amp;#39;Blackism&amp;#39;.  You&amp;#39;d probably think, well, that&amp;#39;s a shitty name, not only because there&amp;#39;s a lot of disenfranchised races and it&amp;#39;s weird to pick out one, but because it just SOUNDS like a black power movement full stop, which is bound to turn off many potential allies before they have a chance to dig into the movement and see that its core message is something that is actually very desirable.  How could &amp;#39;Feminism&amp;#39; be any different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a note, I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that Feminism would become universally accepted overnight if it had the name change I&amp;#39;m advocating for, I&amp;#39;m saying that it would make it easier for at least some people who currently view Feminism in a negative light to be more open minded to the movement.  If it would help to recruit at least some more supporters (whether they be people alive today or future persons who might have been turned off the movement by the name &amp;#39;Feminism&amp;#39;), then why wouldn&amp;#39;t we want to do it?  What would be the countervailing harm the name change would or might cause that could justify us keeping the name &amp;#39;Feminism&amp;#39;?  Also, if you&amp;#39;re tempted to respond that &amp;#39;those who are stupid enough to view Feminism as a women&amp;#39;s power movement shouldn&amp;#39;t be our concern&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;people who make that mistake should educate themselves&amp;#39;, then I would respond that 1) one of the central goals of Feminism is the widespread acceptance of the core Feminist message, and to do this we’ll need to get comfortable marketing the movement to people who view the movement in ways people who support the movement might find &amp;#39;stupid&amp;#39;. 2) why wait for uneducated people to educate themselves, when you can do something right now (that is very easy to do I might add) that makes them less likely to make the mistake you consider to be so stupid in the first place?  It seems very arrogant and even reckless to prefer to sit back and wait for others to see the light, so to speak - especially when leaving gender inequality unresolved has real consequences that are measured in human suffering!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I know there is no central organization to the feminist movement, so I know that there is no governing body that can unilaterally decide on the name change I&amp;#39;m advocating for.  However, if feminists started referring to themselves as Gender-Egalitarians and said that they were moved to this name change out of a concern that the name alienates many people who they hope to one day call allies, I think the movement could for all intents and purposes be considered renamed in fairly short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very curious to see what people think are good reasons for resisting the name change I&amp;#39;m advocating for! :)&lt;/p&gt;
