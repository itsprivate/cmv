This is not about the legitimacy of the draft, it is about the balance of rights and responsibilities amongst equals. This actually was a counter argument to the suffragettes during the debates over the 19th amendment that they would then have to bear the burden of eligibility for the draft. they should be eligible for the draft because that is a step towards balancing rights and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scrolling through my new found sub Reddit library I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;/r/femaledatingstrategy&quot;&gt;r/femaledatingstrategy&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My God...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you need be a woman to post there.  And it&amp;#39;s no reason why.  The post itself was a financial breakdown of what woman is &amp;quot;worth&amp;quot; based on the jobs they do for free for men.  Nurse.  Cook.  Cheerleader.  Etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it was a joke but it was honestly dozens of comments spewing hate towards men.  What got me was many of these ladies were tearing into &amp;quot;what being with a man is like&amp;quot; Through speculation alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;#39;t a single comment to offer any sort of perspective.  It was just pitch forks and torches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another was one of my favorite to lurk, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/blackpeopletwitter&quot;&gt;r/blackpeopletwitter&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s so funny, that Im often visiting that sub when I need a good laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I post there?  Nope.  Guess why?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why a sub Reddit is locked down in such a way when being a bigoted, misogynistic, racist is a bankable offense.  Sure, some see subs like that as low hanging fruit but man.  It&amp;#39;s crazy to think that we have to go so far as to lock entire genders or races out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we not trying to seperate ourselves from this?&lt;/p&gt;

But there is always a small percentage that will not work and even if they do we don’t get anything meaningful out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if we paid a basic universal income so those who genuinely can’t or have no desire to work can do what they want instead, the rest of the population can continue to earn more money and we can move forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would reduce crime, and it would also mean that we no longer have to worry about those who do not have a job, either because they don’t want one or because they are down on their luck/are disabled. It lets them live out a basic lifestyle while anyone else who wants more can go earn money and contribute to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think this is I got redundancy 12 years ago and I took 6 months off because I was financially secure for at least a year on the redundancy payment. In that 6 months I got to have a proper rest, and I then got another job and haven’t looked back. I think if the financial pressures were off people and anyone could do this, ultimately it would go a long way for mental health and mean the people who are working will be doing it because they want to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it would have a side effect of jobs paying more than the bare minimum because they would have to make it an attractive prospect to get us to come work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love someone to be able to tel me no this isn’t right and convince me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with allowing companies to have their employees sign morality clauses is that morality is gray subject. We can see this with abortion in a political sense. If employers are able to say dictate what’s morale or not, what’s to stop them from telling their employees to vote for certain individuals who are their “morale protectors”. I think allowing companies to have a say in what individuals can do outside of work will lead us down the wrong spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

The reality is that for the avergage person, science is a sort of faith. The average person does not have the time or understanding to become fully educated on a subject. It takes a lifetime to get there. Therefore, their views which are &amp;quot;backed up&amp;quot; by science are actually just backed up by faith that whoever did the science did it properly. You are putting your faith in scientists so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, science is different from religion in the sense that in theory you could study a topic and hopefully arrive at the same conclusions that others got to independently of you. But, the average person can&amp;#39;t do that so they must treat it as a faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often also misunderstand science and you see it all the time on reddit. A common example is when people link peer reviewed articles and use it as &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; for their argument. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of science. For one, a few articles are not proof, they are evidence, and there&amp;#39;s a big difference there. For two, the scientific method requires reproducability and repetition. Linking 1 or hell even 10 articles may not be sufficient evidence, the more articles there are, the stronger the evidence is, but something can&amp;#39;t be taken as truth unless it has had dozens of articles published all arriving at the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say someone actually does read the articles, ond of the few people who actually do. Most likely, what they mean is that they read the abstract or maybe even the introduction. But, I&amp;#39;d be willing to bet a lot of money that they didnt read the methodology, results, or discussion sections. Id bet that they always completely skip over the statistics part. And I don&amp;#39;t blame them, statistics is a very complicated subject and even if they did read it I highly doubt they would understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of statistics. As I mentioned, it&amp;#39;s a very complicated subject. Science is often used as almost a synonym for &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot;, or sort of the opposite of &amp;#39;art&amp;#39;. Art is usually taken to mean something that has a degree of humans making almost arbitrary instinctive decisions. This applies to science as well. There is art in science, it&amp;#39;s not as exact as most people like to believe. Statistics is a great example and also highlights why dozens of studies are necessary to be confident in a conclusion. Statistics and study design deals with trying to factor for all the biases and unknowns. The problem with that is, how do you know that which you don&amp;#39;t know? How do you know you accounted for everything? You can&amp;#39;t know, and that&amp;#39;s where the art is in designing studies well. This &amp;quot;unknowability of the unknown&amp;quot; is also why linking a handful of studies is weak evidence. It can be STRONGER evidence than what the other side has presented, but it&amp;#39;s still weak evidence. You really do need dozens of studies done by many independent researchers to be able to claim strong evidence for something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, science requires faith and it&amp;#39;s unavoidable for the average person. You&amp;#39;re putting your faith that the scientists who are also just human did a good job. The scientific method only works so far as the humans who practice it practice it properly. And that is frequently not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say this is bad. Science is the best thing we got. It&amp;#39;s just an inevitability, a fact of life that can&amp;#39;t be avoided that we do need a certain degree of faith for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Ready for $5 Gasoline if You Live in California—or if You Don’t...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden State laws drive up prices at the pump, and the Biden administration aims to take them national...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do California drivers pay so much at the pump? Blame a higher-octane blend of taxes and environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-5-gasoline-if-you-live-in-californiaor-if-you-dont-11622226479?mod=hp_opin_pos_2&quot;&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-5-gasoline-if-you-live-in-californiaor-if-you-dont-11622226479?mod=hp_opin_pos_2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My view:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxing gasoline is an effective, and perhaps essential strategy for any government to shift consumer behavior to alternate means of energy. The most obvious and widespread first-order effect of increasing gasoline is the cost of transportation using ICE vehicles. Governments hope that higher gasoline prices coupled with incentives on electric vehicles will result in consumers shifting to EVs over time, reducing the dependency on fossil fuel. &lt;strong&gt;My view&lt;/strong&gt; is that in the US, raising gasoline prices before viable alternatives are ready is jumping the gun because it disproportionately hurts a family who cannot afford an EV. I believe there are better ways of spending the money than giving it to a family earning $249k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To substantiate my view, I will offer what I believe to be a more sensible counter-proposal to the expected US Federal Govt changes, which in brief are: gas taxes ($1-2 extra per gallon, and more over time), and EV incentives ($7k point-of-sale discount for those earning less than $250k) via the infrastructure plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer an income-scaled incentive for EVs that proportionately benefits low-earners, starting at $10k and phasing out to $1k between for those between 75k and 200k household income (which are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dqydj.com/household-income-percentile-calculator/&quot;&gt;50th and 90th&lt;/a&gt; percentiles respectively). A few example values; $50k income = 10k incentive, $100k = $7k, $150k = $3k, $250k = $0. &lt;em&gt;Note: There are challenges with conflating income with wealth / purchasing power, but for the sake for this argument I will assume that&amp;#39;s a solved problem in the proposed federal plan that uses $250k as the cutoff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announce a plan for raising gasoline prices to $1 a gallon per year over a 5 year period, coupled with an outreach / marketing program to sell Americans on the benefits of EVs - including a calculator that illustrates their 5-year savings. I chose 5 years as the amount of time it takes to build out sufficient charger infrastructure to make EVs a viable choice for most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine 4 families in 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$7k incentive / $5 gallon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$10k incentive / $3 gallon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;75k (50th)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$7k incentive / $5 gallon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$10k incentive / $3 gallon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$7k incentive / $5 gallon&lt;/td&gt;

It can cause serious brain damage that lasts into adulthood, predisposing the abused individual to depression, schizophrenia, neurocognitive deficits such as lower IQ and academic performance, irritability, aggression, suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, attachment disorders, and a dysregulated stress response. And that’s just the brain. These impairments in turn can cause shortened telomeres, increase low grade inflammation, poor metabolic regulation, leading to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disorders and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment is also less effective in many patients of this population. Depression, for instance, tends to be more severe and more likely to be treatment resistant. All of which can culminate in lower employment and financial success and a shorter lifespan.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I support the creation of a database for child abusers. I believe anyone convicted of a crime related to childhood maltreatment or deemed to be a maltreater by CPS or the courts should be required to register as a child abuser. This should also show up when they apply for anything requiring a credit check or for a job. They should also be required to publicly disclose that they are an abuser, even if the outcome is severely detrimental to them. These people create broken adults, and should be made to pay for it. As a society, we should want a world where abusing a child results in you losing your job and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

They should have the money available after all because they aren’t paying that person. Why is it fair to make you do something essentially for free that they were paying someone to do before? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear this arrangement doesn’t have to be a formal order to officially do the job of the former employee. If your daily responsibilities grow simply by nature of that person being out, then you have a pretty good case for additional pay as well. If there are two cooks in the kitchen and now there is only one it is obvious that the remaining one is doing at least some of the work of the other person especially if the output has not slipped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of cost-cutting layoffs, all bets are off because obviously, the point of letting the other person go was to save money. The person doing extra work still has a legit gripe, but a different one than in the case of a vacancy because the money is not assumed to be available in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a manager or a person in a flexible role whose job is to pick up slack then this doesn’t apply. But many people are forced to go above and beyond their job descriptions and do tasks that companies have literally already budgeted and allocated money for. That money should be attached to the individual responsibilities in the case of a vacancy, not the person.&lt;/p&gt;

I love chickens, I do, but ducks take the crown. Here are my arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) They&amp;#39;re significantly cuter. No offense, chicks, but ducklings will win every time. Even as adults they&amp;#39;re hilarious to watch - they just stumble around all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) They might have loud quacks, but there&amp;#39;s no crowing to wake you up at 4AM. Every morning my chickens wake me up before the sun comes up, but my ducks are chilling the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Their eggs are superior - typically larger, better for baking, and people with egg allergies can often actually eat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Their meat is delicious and just as versatile as chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) (Mild gore warning) Chickens will cannibalize each other if one dies and if they see blood on even a minor wound they will absolutely terrorize their former chicken friend. Once worked on a farm with pasture-raised hens that had plenty of space, no stressors, and when one chicken got a little nick on her head her companions literally pecked it further open until she had a quarter-size opening on her head and her skull was visible. She ended up dying. Meanwhile I had a duck that got a cut on his back and his companions literally did not care - he got plenty of time to heal up and they didn&amp;#39;t peck him to death like assholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only con is that they&amp;#39;re messy, and you know what? I&amp;#39;ll take messy over pecking each other to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMV? Bonus points for convincing photos/videos of chickens doing good chicken things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a world where this wasn&amp;#39;t a problem as social media didn&amp;#39;t really exist, but how do we know our kids won&amp;#39;t hate the sea of pictures there are of them online when they become of age that they did not consent to. All my friends post so many pictures of their kids, which is great because they are proud to be parents, but I feel that if I was there child when I grew up I would be pissed at all these dumb and embarrassing photos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are opening them up to exposure to the scummy parts of the internet, which is really the most disturbing reason. Anybody could grab pictures of your children and use them for whatever they want, this seems unsafe, even though your child isn&amp;#39;t directly harmed, it is still a scary thought to think of anybody out there can see these pictures of your kids, especially the sickos on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything I would advocate for small private photo albums on Facebook or Instagram so maybe the grandparents can see pictures, but even then, what&amp;#39;s wrong with giving people pictures at Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not advocating for mandating anything, but just that we should, as a society frown upon it. However I recognize not being a parent puts me in a position to not entirely understand that side of things. Please point out the things I may be missing.&lt;/p&gt;

This percentage could be way lower if nuclear energy was used more widespread. Producing one TWh with a coal plant sets free 273 times the amount of emissions compared to nuclear energy. Furthermore, the production of electricity with coal plants kills about 400 times more people than producing the same amount with a nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the events of Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011, nuclear energy became irrationally feared, even though it is massively safer and cleaner than its alternatives .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Besides solar, wind and hydropower, as using just those sources is inefficient and inpractable. Inefficient because at some point the potential growth of i.e. hydropower will be limited when most big flows are already producing electricity. Ineffective because only nuclear power plants can satisfy the base load with a constant stream of energy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after the disasters, politics and minds shifted to exit nuclear energy, even though the naked numbers are in favour of it. Germany is phasing out its nuclear power plants and mostly filled the electricity gap with coal energy, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;which led to the release of an additional 36 million tons of carbon dioxide per year (...) More distressingly, the researchers estimated that burning more coal led to local increases in particle pollution and sulfur dioxide and likely killed an additional 1,100 people per year from respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, nuclear energy is clean and safe (or at least less dirty and less dangerous than the alternatives). Even though it is so unpopular now, combined with solar, wind and hydropower, nuclear power can supply the electricity needs of the people in a cleaner and safer way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the electricity demand would be supplied by coal plants, about 548&amp;#39;949 would die each year from the consequences of the pollution (Multiplication of the global TWh consumption with deaths from coal energy per TWh) . If all the electricity is being supplied by nuclear power plants, about 1562 people die each year from the consequences. So by substituting nuclear for coal, hundreds of thousands of people would not be killed. As coal is right now responsible for 27% of world energy production, about 147&amp;#39;794 people could be saved yearly from dying by cardiovascular diseases simply by switching to nuclear energy (Substraction of 27% of 1562 from 27% of 548&amp;#39;949).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear power has the potential to decrease the number of people dying of cardiovascular deseases by the hundreds of thousands, and finally limit climate change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ive posted memes on twitter that i think are the most mild jokes but sometimes people get so worked up over it. I get nervous and delete old stuff because who knows what will be considered offensive in 5, 10, or 20 years from now.

However, not wanting to date a black person due to not being attracted to skin colour is not racist.&lt;br/&gt;
Most people have preferences based on weight, height, face shape, etc. Most women would not want to date a shorter man.  Gay men are not attracted to women and lesbians are not attracted to men. Attraction is no more a choice than taste in food or art. I did not choose to like vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake whilst disliking chocolate ice cream and watermelon.&lt;br/&gt;
So if not being attracted to black people or Asian people is racist, are gay men sexist?&lt;br/&gt;
For my view to be changed, one would have to explain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How not being attracted to a certain race is racist whilst being gay is not sexist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How attraction to skin colour or other features is any different than attraction (or lack thereof) to weight or height.&lt;/li&gt;

There are extreme cases like Bob Dylan, who can hardly sing at all, but more generally I don&amp;#39;t find anything impressive about the musical talents of the average musician you hear on the radio.  I&amp;#39;ve often heard random people singing in coffee shops or college a capella groups who can do a better job musically with the same songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d contrast this to the situation with professional sports.  Take, say, Olympic sprinters.  These are the fastest people in the world.  There&amp;#39;s close to no chance that someone who didn&amp;#39;t qualify for the Olympics (unless they were thrown out for drugs or something) could possibly beat the Olympic champion, who really is the &amp;quot;fastest man in the world&amp;quot; at that point of time.  Or take the NBA.  The 500 or so people currently on NBA rosters are a pretty good approximation of the 500 best basketball players in the world.  I&amp;#39;m sure there are some who would be swapped in an objective ranking, but you&amp;#39;d end up with a pretty similar talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you selected the 500 most successful musicians in the world right now (e.g., most sales or something) and you objectively selected the 500 most talented musicians, I doubt there would be much if any overlap.  Instead of talent, success as a musician has a lot to do with luck, branding, appearance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I think your average star is a lot more musically talented than a random person on the street.   Most of them are probably at the 90th percentile of musical talent or better.  But my point is that the average star doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have more talent than tens of thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of people who sing in a capella group, play in a wedding band, or do gigs in front of 14 people at a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly this is all subjective, but you can change my view by convincing me that musical stars actually are uniquely talented on not just fairly good musicians who succeeded on the basis of other attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: To put this a slightly different way, I&amp;#39;m saying that if we selected the best musicians by blind audition, essentially none of the most popular musicians today would make the cut.  On the other hand, if we selected Olympic sprinters blind, we&amp;#39;d end up with the same people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to Clarify: By talented, I mean &amp;quot;musically talented.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Light mode is bad at night since it’s too bright compared to the stuff around you, but dark mode never appears too dim, since the text is white and has a nice contrast against the dark background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, dark mode is easier on your eyes, and looks just as good or even better than light mode, so dark mode is overall better than light mode.&lt;/p&gt;

When people on the political right say &amp;quot;socialism,&amp;quot; they typically have in mind a poorly-run welfare state at best and brutal totalitarianism at worst. I realize this is due to lingering effects of the Red Scare and our right-biased Overton Window, but it is the case regardless. On its own, this should be enough to discourage the use of this term if only one side of a debate really knows what it means, but I think it goes deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find that liberals and people who lean politically left in the US often have a fuzzy conception of &amp;quot;socialism&amp;quot; as well. They tend to lump AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Nordic countries all under this &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot; umbrella, when what all of these have in common is &lt;em&gt;social democracy&lt;/em&gt;, not socialism. Places like Sweden and Norway operate with capitalist economies and most of what AOC and Bernie push for is completely compatible with capitalism, albeit in a modified form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think is happening is that when people say &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot; in the positive sense in the US, what they probably mean is &lt;em&gt;Keynesian&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the government doing stuff). That is, the focus tends to be on the role of government and social programs more than workplace power dynamics (e.g., labor vs. the owner class) and the fundamental incentive structure of the economy. To my understanding, basic socialist ideology is agnostic to the role and structure of government, ranging from radically democratic to decidedly-NOT democratic (hence why the left tends to split off into so many factions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not merely making this argument from the abstract &amp;quot;words mean things&amp;quot; stance (though this does partially motivate the argument because, of course). Controversy and lack of clarity have real world impacts on public views and political behavior. For instance, Americans broadly support progressive, social democratic labor laws, such as expanding the power of unions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/labor_unions.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/labor_unions.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), whereas most Americans by and large tend to dislike things that are labelled as &amp;quot;socialist/socialism&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/287459/public-opinion-review-americans-word-socialism.aspx&quot;&gt;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/287459/public-opinion-review-americans-word-socialism.aspx&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I am not arguing for the literal censorship of the word &amp;quot;socialism.&amp;quot; Furthermore, I understand that words and concepts morph over time; however, I would argue that in the US &amp;quot;socialism&amp;quot; has evolved into splintered meanings, depending on political community, without consensus, making it a bad word for political debate. Thus, I am making a pragmatic argument -- we should avoid using a term in our discussions and debates that is misunderstood, loaded, and, in my opinion, beyond salvaging in our political context.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately many car manufacturers think it is okay to eliminate old-school tactile buttons and knobs and integrate them in the infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, when a driver wants to adjusts say AC temperature, they have to push touch screen buttons, instead of just turning an old-style clicky knob. Since touch screen does not provide tactile feedback, the driver must &amp;quot;compensate&amp;quot; for the lack of this feedback with vision and this means they have to take their eyes off of the road for a longer duration. I think this is a safety risk and the following buttons and adjusters should never become all-touchscreen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume knob&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC temperature Knob&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC vent chooser buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC vent direction sliders (looking at you Porsche)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any and all buttons on the steering wheel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might ask about the situation when the manufacturer wants to provide advanced controls, my answer would be to put simple tactile button controls on the console AND put advanced controls in the touchscreen menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;/u/Rit0tiR45&quot;&gt;/u/Rit0tiR45&lt;/a&gt; I just found out that Tesla Model 3 can&amp;#39;t adjust windscreen wipers&amp;#39; speed without touch controls, this seems to me the most serious safety risk of all.
Many comments suggest, that since many new cars come with voice controls, this is not a big issue. 
My response is:
1. Voice controls in cars are famously wonky and even if they improve-
2. Some people are non-verbal
3. Many cars get exported to foreign countries, especially after they get older and some people are unable to speak the languages the car supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israeli&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t have a legitimate claim to Palestine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was never an Israel before their nation was created in 1948 (in direct violation of standing international agreements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories of ancient tribes of people in 1000 BCE&amp;#39;s (&lt;em&gt;over 3000 years ago&lt;/em&gt;) don&amp;#39;t count as a legitimate claim to an inhabited territory. All written evidence from this time period is shrouded in religious fiction, and even if it wasn&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t invade a nation because you claim you had ancestors that lived there 3000 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If having a kingdom in a place a long time ago was justification for the occupation of another sovereign state we would still be in the middle ages and virtually every other peoples that has ruled Palestine over the last 3000 years (Assyrians, Iranians, Greeks, Egyptians, Italians, Syrians, Abbassids, Fatmids, Ayyubids, Mamluks, and Turks) would have a better claim than Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ottoman Empire ruled Palestine for the last 530 years until their occupation, dissolution and partition at the end of WWI for being on the wrong side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The territories that were formerly controlled by the ancient empire were then divided up by westerners with no concept or care of the culture or politics of the region creating the sublimation point for virtually every sectarian crisis since then in the middle east.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UK creates Mandatory Palestine and manages to promise the territory to themselves (while also promising France they could have Syria), the prince of Mecca that he could have all of modern day Saudi Arabia and Palestine in exchange for leading a revolution in 1915 against the Ottoman Empire (which he totally did), and to the Zionists with the Balfour declaration. I mean what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the creation of the United Nations and being totally out of fucks to give, the UK gives them a really easy first problem to ponder and promptly fucks off like it was never involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United Nations makes some toothless declarations that the Zionists ignore and in 1948 they go to war with the native populace displacing over 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in the process and creating the new state of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the UK prioritized the issue and committed to solving it the last 80 years we wouldn&amp;#39;t be in this mess. The occupation of Palestine is a direct result of the partition of the Ottoman empire and the United Kingdom&amp;#39;s colony in Mandatory Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United Kingdom has power and leverage that the UN did not and still does not have, so by passing the issue to the international community to handle, they knowingly created the pretext and environment that has caused so much violence and claimed so many lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the United Kingdom not taken a backseat role the last 80 years things could of been very different, and in my opinion they have an obligation to rectify the conflict they created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 100% open to being wrong about this, but I don&amp;#39;t see a conceivable reason for the United Kingdom&amp;#39;s decisive and frankly morally bankrupt handling of the situation over the last century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there has been so much politicizing the virus itself, leading to misinformation. BY BOTH SIDES. This carried over notably and easily into the vaccines rollout as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems as if you were already pro quarantine/making/shutdowns then you HAD to be all for the vaccine. Like that was part of your camp, your clan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you were less cautious with about the virus itself then you NEED to be against the vaccine and be blowing the horn about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; possible side effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no productive rational discussion can happen between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is more detrimental than the virus itself because if the public had been given the straight unvarnished truth to begin with- nobody would have felt played. No governors, senators, or doctors would have made moves that put lives at risk just to prove political points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of people i see dismiss anything to their left as &amp;quot;communist&amp;quot; or anything to their right as &amp;quot;fascist&amp;quot; or any other absurd pejorative to disregard someones point out of hand is beyond counting. I too often see people treat politics and discussions about social issues like a team sport when that isnt helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have met people who are adamantly against things that are clearly in their interests simply because thats what the other side wants. A great example is that the anti abortion people are so often also against sex education about contraception when that has a measurable impact on reducing teen pregnancies and thus abortions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would simply suggest people forget the imaginary lines between parties and ideologies when actually considering peoples points, does this actually help society? do i have a good reason to disagree besides them just being a point on a side i dont usually vote for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is with corruption, not with capitalism. Corruption can exist under socialism too, to the point where all the issues that plague us today, would be just as prevalent under socialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever there exists an imbalance of power, the powerful can take advantage of the powerless. Power imbalances exist regardless of economic system - even in hunter-gatherer tribes which were considered very egalitarian, there were power imbalances. The problem with large scale economic systems is that power vests over time. When power vests, it becomes harder to upset the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think capitalism is perfect and incorruptible, but blaming it for all our problems isn&amp;#39;t addressing the root cause - which is the cliche that &amp;quot;power has the potential to corrupt&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think power is a problem either, I think power is necessary for meaningful action and progress to be made. I just think we need to find a way for power to be refreshed from time to time, to prevent stagnation (e.g.: loopholes which &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; the system).&lt;/p&gt;

Wasn&amp;#39;t 100% sure if they were drunk, but they sure looked like it. You&amp;#39;re damn right I immediately called and reported it. I would do it again on every day that ends in &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;. People&amp;#39;s lives and well being were at risk. Yet, some would still mock people for calling in stuff like this. And in some certain places, could end up assaulting them or killing them for &amp;quot;snitching&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t understand why people are so afraid of being labeled as something, even though they clearly did the right thing by reporting it. And I don&amp;#39;t understand why certain people have the &amp;quot;snitches get stitches&amp;quot; mindset.

&lt;p&gt;I have a neighbor who won’t let her 5 year old more than arms reach away. Playing tag? Not allowed, because she’s too far away. Not allowed a single popsicle on a hot day because it’s “too sugary” (this is a perfectly healthy child, not diabetic or any reason that the amount of sugar in a popsicle would be dangerous).

&lt;p&gt;Like keep your kids safe, obviously- but physical health is only ONE small part of what makes up a well rounded healthy child. if you are stopping your kids from exploring, or meeting new people, or participating in activities because of YOUR anxieties, that’s wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

With that in mind, straying outside of communities you’ve signed up for is already a bit risky. You never know when something you say could lead to you being harassed, and even having some comment made genuinely in the wrong sub leading to bunch of downvotes that only lead you to delete your post to avoid the stress of arguing with anonymous people on the internet. No one likes sticking around for a fight, and trying to make a genuine point can sometimes be a demoralizing and unnecessary outcome of saying what you think. That being said, some subs just pop up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like following politics? Well on the news section of reddit, you will be forward posts from &lt;a href=&quot;/r/politics&quot;&gt;r/politics&lt;/a&gt;, which has one opinion that you can either agree with or be shunned. Don’t like what’s being posted on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/conservative&quot;&gt;r/conservative&lt;/a&gt;? Too bad. They’re gonna come up whether you like them or not. I think telling reddit what we’d like to see also should come with the customizability to tell them what we don’t want to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the news feeds of certain subs are littered with links to sites that have paywalls, and if I’m always being recommended posts from these subs, it can be irritating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk about the dangers of eco chambers, but Reddit’s downvote system only serves to punish descent, so its not as though reddit isn’t a cluster of echo chambers. There is just the illusion that we deserve our fate for saying unpopular things. But what about the mental health of those involved? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, CMV is one of the only subs I see where people welcome each other to be challenging of each other’s views, and welcomes civil debate. There are others, but I feel like it’d be rather controversial to name names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit gives all these tools to allow subs to keep out unwanted guests, and I think that’s great. Its fine to say that’s if you are in a sub that is a support group for something, you would want to keep certain people, who are sure to exacerbate things, from posting there. So why not afford people, who are trying to keep their feed free of the negativity and vitriol of our current environment from that, for the purposes of their mental health? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that we should allow ourselves to be exposed to ideas with which we disagree, and that it is healthy to be open to different points of view, but if you can’t challenge your ideas by engaging in debate, you’re just going to get entrenched. We need the ability to talk things out rather than just be talked at, but since we’re not going to magically make everyone on reddit civil, maybe we can just have the ability to turn off certain subs, and better control our own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit] Thanks for the comments! I have to stress though that this wasn’t “how to” request. I think this should be an official Reddit feature. I think Reddit should allow it on principle. If you have any reason that Reddit should not allow this, please let me know...&lt;/p&gt;

This concept seems cruel to me for many reasons (assuming parents can afford to still have the kid there):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high school education alone is not enough to get you paid a living wage in many areas of the country. By kicking your child out, they are likely doomed to poverty, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they try to go to college to get a better job, they will be saddled with student loans and then have rent to pay in top of that. Even if they want to study a trade, they may rack up debt or not have resources to do so. As a result they may not finish school or will be paying off loans for 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents never kicked me out. I left a bit after graduating college and getting established in a job. I was able to move out on my own terms and I&amp;#39;m doing great in life. I own a house, have a stable job and good savings, etc. I think I owe a lot of my current stability and success to my parent&amp;#39;s support in late teens/early 20s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an 18 year old wants to leave, that&amp;#39;s no problem, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t be forced to. In today&amp;#39;s society you generally need longer to get ready to live independently. CMV&lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;#39;t help but feel like it&amp;#39;s a huge effort for ultimately little return, though. Like, in 2 or 3 generations, even the most famous movies will have been forgotten and so will their stories, no matter how life-changing or inspiring they may be. Can anyone convince me otherwise or name any counter-examples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think films can have a big impact on someone&amp;#39;s life on a personal level, but it&amp;#39;s limited to just that. No matter how good the story may be, I feel like films don&amp;#39;t have the same longevity as famous novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that might only be because the film industry is relatively young, compared to other mediums of story-telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glitter and sparkles, below a certain diameter, pose enough ecological, ethical, and human health problems to warrant legal control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My reasons:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecological- Glitter and sparkles are ostensibly no different than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/microbead-free-waters-act-faqs&quot;&gt;microbead plastics&lt;/a&gt; which were banned for ecological concerns. Microbeads were traveling through the water systems and ending up in the guts of fish. Glitter and sparkles, while visually distinct, are used in many of the same aplications. Glitter, along with its many other applications, is used in bath bombs and make-up, both of which end up in the sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethical- Glitter and sparkles do not ask for consent. Everyone knows that glitter and sparkles get everywhere and are almost impossible to fully remove. It&amp;#39;s so well known, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4T_LlK1VE4&quot;&gt;Mark Rober used glitter and sparkles as a non-lethal booby trap&lt;/a&gt; against porch pirates. Glitter can leave whatever surface it is on and attach itself to you. Pick up one piece of glitter paper, or a Christmas ornament you didn&amp;#39;t know had glitter on it? Well, now it&amp;#39;s on your hands and everything else you touch. Washing your hands vigorously rarely removes all the glitter, and it now is going back to problem 1. You&amp;#39;ve washed microplastics into the ocean. Cool. If you don&amp;#39;t get the glitter off your hands, it can end up in your food, on your phone, in your electronics, in your clothes, and maybe even in your personal projects, paintings, or other work. While glitter &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be sealed, preventing the non-consensual spread, it rarely is. I have had to throw out entire reams of paper because glitter touched them and now I can&amp;#39;t put them through my printer without damaging it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subpoint- imagine it was legal to leave a wet layer of paint on merchandise in the store. The paint MAY be dry, it MAY not be dry. You don&amp;#39;t know until you touch it. That sounds insane, right? Well, it&amp;#39;s the same thing with glitter. You don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s sealed until you touch it, at which point it&amp;#39;s too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health- Glitter has been known to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19943746/woman-with-glitter-stuck-in-eye/&quot;&gt;health hazard and can be lethal&lt;/a&gt;, or at least dangerous, if not treated quickly. Glitter and sparkles below a certain diameter can end up consumed, adding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/microplastic-particles-discovered-in-human-organs#:%7E:text=People%20are%20also%20known%20to,traces%20of%20plastic%20in%20tissue.&quot;&gt;microplastics that are&lt;/a&gt; already building up in our systems. It&amp;#39;s inarguable that glitter and sparkles, by their very shape and size, are not contributing to this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will not change my mind:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whataboutism arguments saying&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;Well this thing is also a microplastic, should that not be controlled?&amp;quot; I would simply say, &amp;quot;yes, it should. &amp;quot; I believe microplastics and other plastic waste is a danger on all fronts and should have more controls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claims that glitter can be easily cleaned and managed&lt;/em&gt; if you &amp;quot;just do this...&amp;quot;. No. It really can&amp;#39;t. Companies often do not seal their glitter products. If glitter was easy to control and remove, then it wouldn&amp;#39;t be used as an annoying trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victim blaming&lt;/em&gt; statements like, &amp;quot;just don&amp;#39;t buy glitter products&amp;quot;.  Even if you went through life not buying or purposely touching glitter, you would still touch it at some point. It&amp;#39;s on art supplies, children&amp;#39;s toys, and knickknacks. It&amp;#39;s in holiday decorations, soaps, makeup, and cheap T-shirts. If a product on the shelf is within two or three feet of something with glitter on it. It will also be contaminated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sentimental&lt;/em&gt; arguments like &amp;quot;glitter is pretty&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s useful for decoration&amp;quot;. I did not say ALL glitter should be a controlled substance, just below a certain diameter. It should not be possible to pick up extremely fine glitter particles (diameter TBD) without also purchasing a sealer or other substance to manage the application and spread of the glitter. It should not be possible to buy fine glitter particles in any basic store like Walmart. It should be an 18+ product purchased at a more specialized store, similar to how flammable substances are handled. If someone wants to decorate with glitter, I would absolutely say that they can, but only with larger particles that are more easily seen and managed. Additionally, companies could still use glitter in products but MUST be required to seal those products with a varnish or glue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that WILL change my mind:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that a law already exists to curtail the current use of glitter and sparkles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that glitter and sparkles are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; biodegradable, and currently do not pose a microplastic threat. (Although this does not address the other two concerns) They must break down in the environment to a sufficient degree that they do not pose a threat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that legal control of microplastic substances is ineffective and that more harsh measures should be used. We all know that companies will do what they must to make a buck, so it&amp;#39;s likely that any law about glitter or sparkles would be circumvented quickly. Evidence that a legal restriction, like the one on microbeads, would be ineffective would help change my view, but it would only make me feel more strongly that glitter and sparkles are dangerous and problematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that glitter and sparkles are used in scientific applications to such a degree that easy access to them is requisite for some very important task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that glitter is not a health risk to humans in any way, and that previous examples of glitter damaging humans, or contributing to human microplastic contamination is not happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other logical arguments I haven&amp;#39;t thought of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading- Please change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(No TLDR because I don&amp;#39;t want to waste time answering questions that have been answered in my post)&lt;/p&gt;

But the official reaction to the large increase in UFO sightings, almost always during Naval excercises, indicates a terrible blind spot.

&lt;p&gt;And bad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like holy shit bad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took our orders for appetizers and then went around the table again for entrees and stopped one short so my friend had to call her back after she turned around to place his order.  She forgot drinks (Same friend didn&amp;#39;t get his beer when she brought the rest of ours over) and someone from the back had to come out to pitch in and there was this one part where we moved from inside to outside and I was trailing behind and she double checked with me what the others have ordered.  The place was half empty and she had about 2 other tables to take care of.  This girl was not overwhelmed in any way shape or form.  2/10 service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; it was pretty clear that she was trying, and our opinions were split clearly into two camps:  Those of us who came from the industry and those who haven&amp;#39;t.  Those of us who did got all nostalgic in a brotherly, fatherly kind of way with &amp;quot;Oh, I remember my first day... what a train-wreck that was&amp;quot; and those of us who didn&amp;#39;t, got really frustrated.  The friend who didn&amp;#39;t get the beer was able to see his beer on the bar and had to be talked into not going over there to get it himself and the others were pretty grumbly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get it- bad service sucks.  I&amp;#39;ve had service so bad that I had to walk over to the waitress station to ask our server, who was on her phone, for our bill after about 20 or 30 minutes of trying to flag her down.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re trying and are still bad at your job, I have endless patience for you.  We all had a first day and if anything, I&amp;#39;d blame the owner for hiring her in the first place, but not everyone has previous experience to put on their resumes.&lt;/p&gt;

For the life of me, I cannot comprehend that view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Trump is a criminal, a racist, an idiot, and a narcissistic sociopath who would happily kill to get his way – &lt;em&gt;but look at his predecessors!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FDR operated concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truman nuked 200,000 civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson sent mentally retarded teenagers to die in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reagan’s War on Drugs (happily continued by his successors from both parties) incarcerated millions of people and devastated Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush Jr. legalized torture and started a war that killed at least half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to those mind-boggling feats of evil, Trump’s “accomplishments” just seem… &lt;em&gt;meh.&lt;/em&gt; The most infamous event of his presidency, the storming of the Capitol, was a one-day affair that led to a grand total of five casualties. It was a terrible crime with major political implications, and Trump is 100% responsible for it. But it pales in comparison to the Vietnam War, which killed 60,000 Americans and traumatized an entire generation (not to mention its effects in Vietnam itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the WHO. It’s flabbergasting to see people’s sudden outrage at this, considering that “fuck everyone else” has been the main theme of US foreign policy &lt;em&gt;basically since forever.&lt;/em&gt; The US passed a law permitting themselves to invade the Hague. The US is the &lt;em&gt;only(!)&lt;/em&gt; UN member that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US hasn’t even paid their full dues to the UN in a long time. Trump’s middle finger to the world was business as usual for America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is a clown who became president almost by accident. His ramblings on social media gave the impression that a complete idiot was in charge. He is evil and if you picked a dozen people at random, he would almost certainly be the worst among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But American presidents are not random people. They are power-obsessed individuals who have committed some of the most horrible crimes in history, including mass murder. &lt;em&gt;As a US president,&lt;/em&gt; Trump was utterly mediocre. At least he didn’t start another war, which in my eyes already puts him above several post-WWII presidents. Obama was better, but Obama was clearly an above-average president. Trump was below average, but calling him the worst of all time when even recent history includes war criminals like Bush reeks of media sensationalism, and is frankly insulting to the hundreds of millions of people around the world whose entire existence has been haunted by what some of Trump’s predecessors have done. &lt;em&gt;Change my view!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course factory farming is less bad than factory farming plus me stubbing my toe, but factory farming plus me stubbing my toe is not a single &amp;quot;thing.&amp;quot;  Similarly, the Holocaust, American slavery, the Armenian Genocide, etc. are all considered single &amp;quot;things,&amp;quot; but hatred / violence in general are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, here we go.  Every year, humans kill around 50 (+-10) billion land animals, the overwhelming majority of whom have lived on factory farms all their lives.  These animals are effectively subject to ongoing torture.  I don&amp;#39;t want to go into all the details, but here are 2 examples.  First, in the pork industry, pigs live in close quarters, in farrowing crates so small they can&amp;#39;t turn around, and sometimes in their own feces.  This induces phycological problems that sometimes lead them to bite each others&amp;#39; tails.  To prevent this, pigs have their tails cut off and their teeth ripped out of their mouths with no anesthetic a few weeks after they&amp;#39;re born.  And secondly, in the beef industry, cows&amp;#39; horns pose a risk to the farmers and the other cows, so factory farmers apply hot irons or torches to the cows heads&amp;#39; to permanently stunt their horns.  I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail if necessary but this should paint enough of a picture of the way factory farmed animals are treated.  They&amp;#39;re subject to unfathomable cruelty and violence from the day they&amp;#39;re born until the day they&amp;#39;re killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t even 8 billion humans alive on the planet today.  If 50 billion people started existing and being tortured, it would be the worst thing to ever happen, by far.  So the next part of the argument requires the moral importance of farm animals to be compared to that of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a less daunting task, comparing the moral value of 2 humans.  We&amp;#39;ll look at 2 hypothetical people with very different circumstances.  The first person is a scientist who has just discovered the cure for cancer, but he hasn&amp;#39;t told anyone yet.  He&amp;#39;s currently running to his lab to spread the good news and start producing the cure right away.  The second person is a 99 year old who&amp;#39;s lived a good life and is on his death bed, about to die peacefully.  The moral value of the scientist is higher than the moral value of the old dude because the scientist has a greater potential to make the world a better place, more years ahead of him etc.  But the old dude getting punched would be just as immoral as the scientist getting punched, because they would suffer the same amount.  With respect to the pain of being punched, differences in intelligence, life expectancy, capacity to do good, etc. aren&amp;#39;t relevant.  The only thing that&amp;#39;s relevant is the pain suffered by the person who was punched.  Kapish?  Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s just apply the same logic to farm animals.  People live longer than farm animals, we&amp;#39;re more sophisticated, we have a greater capacity to make the world a better place, etc.  If given the choice between saving a person and saving a pig, most of us would choose the person.  HOWEVER, pigs suffer just like humans, and so torturing a pig is just as bad as torturing a human.  When a pig is being tortured, differences in life expectancy or intelligence don&amp;#39;t matter at all.  The only thing that matters is the pain the pig experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Wollen captures this idea really succinctly.  &amp;quot;When we suffer, we suffer as equals.  And in their capacity to suffer, a dog is a pig, is a bear, is a boy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that, it&amp;#39;s my position that torturing farm animals is just as bad as doing the same thing to humans.  But let&amp;#39;s suppose you don&amp;#39;t accept that view, and you think it&amp;#39;s 100x worse to torture a person than to torture another animal.  That seems to be a pretty dumb position, but let&amp;#39;s run with it for the sake of discussion.  Even with that assumption, just 1 year of factory farming is still as bad as 500 million people being tortured.  That&amp;#39;s equivalent to over 10 Holocausts, 10 Armenian Genocides, and 130 years of American slavery combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we accept the position that the suffering of a farm animal is just as bad as the suffering of a person?  In that case, an hour and 10 minutes of factory farming is about as bad as the Holocaust, and a week of factory farming is about as bad as 300 years of American slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best I can figure, that&amp;#39;s the worst thing that&amp;#39;s ever happened, by far.  Change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I just hate when people try to change somebody&amp;#39;s mind about changing themselves to fit in.

I&amp;#39;m doing it only to fit in the beauty standard and it&amp;#39;s okay to be honest about that. Nobody is born finding themselves ugly, I used to think of myself as very pretty when I was a little girl. Society&amp;#39;s beauty standards made me hate myself and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with wanting to change something in your body for that reason. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll have a way better self-esteem after I change that little detail that bothers me so much and I really don&amp;#39;t care if I&amp;#39;m perpetuating an unhealthy beauty standard or whatever. I&amp;#39;m not saying you should obsess over every little imperfection (I have many insecurities that I can live with just fine), but when it comes to something that kills your self-esteem completely, I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with wanting to change it just because it&amp;#39;s a society imposed standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also intending for the point of this post to regard personal morals as opposed to laws or the pressure of typical societal standards, but I’ll leave that open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m up for a debate because on the one hand, nudes are just pictures and I’m not afraid for my safety that they’re out in the world. I would have willingly sent them with the understanding that they may be saved. I believe the pictures taken during an event, like sexting, were intended to fade away in the thread like any other conversational text. I also believe the nudes sent randomly or for fun are fine to keep for a while. However, if I ask for them to be deleted following the end of a relationship, the receiver should delete any that were saved. The potential for future use is typically not grounded in innocent reminiscing and I do believe that the vulnerability that comes with sharing nudes is supported by the expectation of respect from the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost this argument with an ex after he sent a text that he still has and uses my photos. I think it’s gross and reflects poorly to keep intimate pictures of a partner after the relationship ended; I would even go as far as believing the recipient should delete the nudes without ever being asked, as the internet will give you photos of people who WANT to be seen, free of charge. At this point I’ve moved on from the situation and just want to hear other views on the matter. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Her argument was that it made them more genuine to the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argued that cultural understanding is more important than ethnicity. Or there may be situations where it won’t matter because the characters ethnicity doesn’t play a strong enough role in the context of the story that it could only be voiced by someone with an understanding of that cultural background. (A good example that comes to mind is Kuzco where him being a mesoAmerican emperor is just a setting, not an important part of the culture for the area)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors train them selves to get into the mindset of other people, it’s silly to think that race could be such a insurmountable barrier of understanding that no actor could voice a character that is a different culture. How could Nancy Cartwright voice Bart Simpson, to the best of my knowledge she has never been a 10-year-old boy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Jewish but don’t speak a word of Hebrew, am I more qualified to voice a character in ancient Israel then someone who isn’t Jewish but actually speaks Hebrew? Japan is a pretty homogenous country, and they have Japanese actors characters voicing characters from all around the world and even cultures that don’t actually exist. Do they need to outsource to find people that speak Japanese and are the same ethnicity of those characters. Is the narrator for an audiobook supposed to not voice one of the characters if it happens to be a different ethnicity, do they need a call a stand in to do the voice for that one character?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they did a blind audition for a character, and found a voice that fit the character perfectly, should they double check to make sure the ethnicity fits too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand having more diversity with the actors applying for roles, but I don’t think forbidding people from acting outside of their ethnicity fixes the problem, it swings too far in the opposite direction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada and Europe Adoption is 100% free, but they make you go though a rigorous process to make sure you are capable and trust worthy enough to raise a child/newborn. That means lots of background checks, living situation checks, making sure you have a stable income and safe living environment and have no problematic past that would make you a risk to the child. If you pass all this then you are free to adopt children and BABIES free of charge vs the 10s of thousands in the US for healthy babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is 100% the way it should be, get those children into homes asap and stop messing around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for Foster care I should explain what I mean by count as a job. Aside from the stipend that you get to use for things the child needs, someone should be allowed to work part time (20 hours) and then get SNAP and other assistance if they are fostering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you OWN the house/condo then you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to work at all and they should give you food and gas assistance because it&amp;#39;s not that much money and you are helping children in need out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this brings the issue of people who don&amp;#39;t actually care for the children going into foster because they just don&amp;#39;t want to work. To get around this, people who want to take the job root should be required to do check ins to confirm what they are spending money on, how much time they are actually at home, if they are taking them to places they need to be and so on. Not that much to ask tbh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I wish they would turn the system from hay to grass pls.&lt;/p&gt;

Planned obsolescence (P.O) is deliberately including design flaws to ensure a product stops working or has reduced performance after a certain amount of time. It does not include items that need to stop working for safety reasons such as an expired gas detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, there are two very similar phones that cost $500 each, one has a P.O date of 2 years, and the other has a P.O date of 5 years.  As each phone gets nearer to it’s P.O date it’s value approaches zero, so after 1 year the first phone is worth less than the second. The second phone represents a better investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not possible for consumers to make the best decision for their financial circumstances without knowing the P.O date and the manufacturer should have to disclose it.&lt;/p&gt;
