I believe if you died of natural causes at a very old age (Maybe 82 plus would be good for setting a standard if NEEDED) you got the full package that life offers you and while everybody has the right to be sad, I believe we should be talking about all the wonderful things about you and give the respective person a cheers to a long and happy life. I don&amp;#39;t think the sad vibe should be culturally expected at a funeral in this instance. It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to have everybody be sad even if they were a saint because they got the best thing they could get from life that some don&amp;#39;t. I feel crying at these events would be expected but the black and gloomy vibe should be dropped and should instead consist of toasts and celebration. I got this thought from a post a while back that mentioned their Grandma was the kind of woman that was a partier and always lived life to the fullest, sounds like she got the best life she could get. So they through more of a party type celebration of their life instead. Just seems like that&amp;#39;d be warranted, although I guess anyone can do what they want I don&amp;#39;t think that expectation is helping mourners instead it&amp;#39;s just making them sadder. Well, I&amp;#39;ve made my case and this is how I feel. Interested to know if my view will be changed. Oops mind the grammar lmao&lt;/p&gt;

I had the opportunity to live in America for college and I worked at restaurants. The pay was amazing. I was earning a ridiculous amount of money. Where I’m from, this was the salary of a high-level manager. I haven’t even graduated and I’m already out earning them. Granted, I know the living standards are different but that’s obvious since your standard of living is higher. The lifestyle of a middle-class person in the Philippines is like the lifestyle of the poor in America. I can’t even begin to describe the poverty that the masses in my country live through (most of the population is very, very poor.) It’s horrifying. I would rather be dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a new iphone, some clothes and gaming laptop, but I kept my expenses to a minimum. I ate out once a month, counted every dollar I spent on groceries/essentials, took public transpo/bike or hitched a ride with co-workers instead of an uber, always ate the employees meal, would take home the free peanuts in Five Guys, etc. I was able to save up so much money while still buying a few luxuries here and there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time there, I met a lot of people. A lot of immigrants who worked hard, single moms who worked hard, single moms who were lazy and mooched off childcare, people my age who worked hard, people my age who slacked off. All kinds of people. I have a lot of respect for the immigrants. We all agree, USA is fucking amazing. We all work our ass off but the payoff is great. Compare to our countries where people slave for a measly $4/per day minimum wage. You can work and work your life away in the Philippines, and there’s very little chance for upward mobility. America is so easy in comparison. These immigrants started off poor but hard work paid off and now they can live a comfortable middle-class lifestyle while still sending money back home to support their families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to be lazy, if you want to be lazy. I met someone who enjoyed a care-free lifestyle. He chose not to work hard because he wants to be laid-back. I respect that. But people on the internet, reddit especially, constantly complain about capitalism or how third-world the USA is becoming. I know you’ve got issues with healthcare and everyone hating each other, but it’s really not that bad… USA is still great. The people constantly complaining just don’t have any perspective on the world. They should book a flight to their third-world country of choice and see for themselves. I always find it ironic how these people hate the rich, when they are actually already considered rich in the eyes of us, people from the third-world. They hate their boss, but they always call-off or are always late then get angry when they are reprimanded. Of course you’ll be paid less and fired more. Your work ethic is terrible! They want to be socialist/communist, but they’re exactly the kind of people who will make communism fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life experience has shown me that the American dream is still alive. I know it’s got issues, like the after mentioned health care, racial tensions, shootings, etc. but in terms of opportunity, it is still unmatched. Hard work and conscientiousness can get you far. People are just too lazy or have such a narrow worldview that they can’t put things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a waste of time going through a whole rack of clothing when 10% of it is actually going going fit me. Even if I&amp;#39;m shopping specifically for black pants, I don&amp;#39;t want to look through all the black pants and realise than none are my size, I&amp;#39;d much rather look at the options that are my size and be like &amp;quot;oh there&amp;#39;s no black pants, oh well at least i didn&amp;#39;t waste my time look through all the black pants!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, nearly all the op shops (Aussie for your American &amp;quot;thrift store&amp;quot;) here sort their clothes by colour, with the odd gem of a store that sorts by size. To me it&amp;#39;s just so much better for the customers and makes browsing a lot more pleasant&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s not a sin within the context of a marriage. This is a doctrine that is causing a lot of harm among many in the LGBTQ community. Without going into the obvious science that has been out there for ages that affirm that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, here I wish to show that Christians (or Jews for that matter) have no basis for condemning it, even with the usual source that they do this with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical passages that are used to condemn homosexuality are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leviticus 18:22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leviticus 20:13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judges 19-20 (cf. the parallel in Genesis 19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 6:9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Timothy 1:10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romans 1:26-27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jude 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, scholars of all kinds agree that the concept of “homosexuality” as a sexual or gender identity first arose in the late 19th century, with no meaningful precursors in antiquity. So the idea that Jesus or his contemporaries would have had opinions about “homosexuality” as an orientation is completely anachronistic. Rather, as Christopher B. Zeichmann (contributor at &lt;a href=&quot;/r/AcademicBiblical&quot;&gt;r/AcademicBiblical&lt;/a&gt;) writes, the &amp;quot;evidence suggests that sexuality tended to be thought of along a series of intersecting axes: penetrator-penetrated, senior-junior, masculine-effeminate, elite-plebian, free-slave, and so on&amp;quot; (Christopher B. Zeichmann, &lt;em&gt;Same-Sex Intercourse Involving Jewish Men 100BCE–100CE: Sources and Significance for Jesus’ Sexual Politics&lt;/em&gt;, Brill, 2020, pp. 13-14). Zeichmann continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, rather than understanding sexuality as an identity grounded in the gender(s) to which one is attracted as is common today, Greeks and Romans instead interpreted specific sexual actions and their affirmation or abrogation of the hegemonic power ideals as paramount. That is to say, today actions are less important than identities: a person can identify as bisexual and be a virgin, a woman may realize she is a lesbian despite her previous sexual experiences all being with men, and so on. In Greek and Roman culture, actions were far more significant than identities, and the importance of sexual intercourse revolved around a handful of questions. Who did you have sex with? Who penetrated whom? What was the social standing of each party? As we will see below, authors in the Roman empire were looking for specific answers: the higher status individual should always be the penetrator and if this were not the case, such intercourse could humiliate and emasculate. Thus, while one can speak of homosexual intercourse, there is reason to doubt that there was a broad identity-based category of “homosexuality” as there is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Christopher B. Zeichmann, &lt;em&gt;Same-Sex Intercourse Involving Jewish Men 100BCE–100CE: Sources and Significance for Jesus’ Sexual Politics&lt;/em&gt;, Brill, 2020, pp. 13-14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arland J. Hultgren similar points in his book &lt;em&gt;Paul&amp;#39;s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary&lt;/em&gt; (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), pp. 101. He even goes as far as to say: &amp;quot;to be sure, there were those in the Greco-Roman world who were aware that some people were attracted to persons of their own gender. But that having been said, there is no evidence in his letters that Paul had such an awareness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Meaning of Arsenokoitai in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greek word that has been translated as &amp;quot;sodimites&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;homosexuals&amp;quot; is &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt; respectfully. The word, &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;, crucial to the traditional translation, is a combination of two Greek words, &lt;em&gt;arsen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;koiten&lt;/em&gt;, which together result in the expression  ‘male-liers’ or ‘liers with males’. To assume this is speaking of same-sex relations universally is a stretch to say the least. The only positive reason to take this word as denoting same-sex relations &lt;em&gt;universally&lt;/em&gt; is because it appears as though Paul may have taken two words from the Septuagint translation of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 (“arsenos” and “koitein”) to both refer to same-sex actions when combined. However, while cited by many to condemn homosexuality as we know it today, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like we know what the crux phrase of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 means. While many assume these texts are clear, they have major difficulties. Most importantly, as Bruce Wells writes: &amp;quot;both contain the phrase מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֔ה (vocalized as miškəbê ʾiššâ), a longstanding crux for interpreters. In fact, Jacques Berlinerblau finds this phrase so unintelligible that he believes scholars should “admit defeat” in light of the perplexities it presents and forgo further attempts to arrive at a sensible interpretation of these biblical texts&amp;quot; (Bruce Wells, &amp;quot;On the Beds of a Woman: The Leviticus Texts on Same-Sex Relations Reconsidered,&amp;quot; T&amp;amp;T Clark, 2020, pp. 124).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meaning of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical English translations on the issue are irrelevant, since most translations are interpretive rather than literal. Berlinerblau says that a literal, secular, translation of Leviticus 18:22 might read something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with a male you will not lie &lt;em&gt;lying downs of a woman&lt;/em&gt;, It is an abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Leviticus, the specific target of the texts is sexual relations between men that occur “on the beds of a woman” (מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֔ה), as Wells translates it. The big question has to be: what does that expression – “on the beds of a woman” (as Wells translates it) or &amp;quot;lying downs of a woman&amp;quot; – mean? A possible suggestion is that the verse condemns male on male incest (since this is the overall aim of Leviticus 18-20). Another potential interpretation is that the texts are basically saying, &amp;#39;don’t have sex with a man who is the sexual partner of a woman.&amp;#39; Many different directions could be had because of the ambiguous phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֔ה that are translated “lying downs of a woman” occurs also in a similar verse (Leviticus 20:13) does little to clarify matters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a man that will lie with a male &lt;em&gt;lying downs of a woman&lt;/em&gt;, the two of them have committed an abomination. They will die. Their blood is upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source of the two translations above = Jacques Berlinerblau, &lt;em&gt;The Secular Bible: Why Nonbelievers Must Take Religion Seriously&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 103.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Boyarin translates Leviticus as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not lie with a man &lt;em&gt;a woman’s lyings&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; (miškĕbē ʾiššā) (Lev 18:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Daniel Boyarin, &lt;em&gt;The Talmud - A Personal Take&lt;/em&gt;, Mohr Siebeck, 2018, pp. 124).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the first phrase would seem to be a clear condemnation of same sex relations between men, but the author adds the very ambiguous phrase discussed above, adding another element to the prohibition, unknown to us modern readers. Thus, there is little reason to assume that Leviticus is condemning sex between men &lt;em&gt;universally speaking&lt;/em&gt; with מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אִשָּׁ֔ה factored in. Wells is a legal specialist (vis-a-vis the OT) and thinks that Leviticus is not condemning sex between men universally (see this 2020 article by Wells &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/42810771/On_the_Beds_of_a_Woman_The_Leviticus_Texts_on_Same_Sex_Relations_Reconsidered&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westarinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sex-or-Sexuality-Revisiting-Lev-18-20-1.pdf&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; 2020 article by Tamar Kamionkowski (published in Westar Institute) translates Lev 18:22 thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not lie the &lt;em&gt;lying downs of a woman&lt;/em&gt; with a man, it is an abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they translate 20:13 as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As for the man, who lies the &lt;em&gt;lying downs of a woman&lt;/em&gt; with a male, they, both of them, have committed an abomination; they shall certainly be put to death, their blood is upon them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text, again, is very ambiguous (see pp. 162-163). Kamionkowski writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several questions arise while examining this verse in Hebrew. Does the text intend “man” or “male?” What does “lying downs of a woman” mean? Are the English additions of “as” or “after the manner of” reasonable and true to the original text? What does the Hebrew word for &amp;quot;abomination” mean? Is it moral or ritual? (pp. 163)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamionkowski goes on to doubt that Leviticus condemns same-sex relations in the article and announces on page 167 that &amp;quot;In short, we simply do not know what the verse means!&amp;quot; I agree with Kamionkowski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meaning of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 6:9 | 1 Timothy 1:10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, even if Paul does get the word &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt; from Leviticus, there is little reason to think that Paul&amp;#39;s use of the words from the Septuagint translation of Leviticus necessarily condemns sex between those of the same gender. There is also a lack of probative evidence of any actual connection of &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt; with an earlier Hebrew term or with the two texts of Leviticus in Rabbinic sources. But granting that Paul does make the compound word from Leviticus, there are eight points that all, when combined, make the condemnation of same-sex relations unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leviticus is vague and more likely than not does not condemn same sex relations between men universally (see above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This compound word &lt;em&gt;does not even show up prior to Paul&amp;#39;s letters in ancient Greek literature&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, Paul made it up! We have little to compare it to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound words do not always mean what the sum of their parts suggests. As Dale Martin writes: &amp;quot;It is highly precarious to try to ascertain the meaning of the word by taking it apart, getting the meaning of its component parts, and than assume, with no supporting evidence, that the meaning of the longer word is a simple combination of its component parts&amp;quot; (Dale B. Martin, &lt;em&gt;Sex and the Single Savior: Gender and Sexuality in Biblical Interpretation,&lt;/em&gt; 2006, pp. 39).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;It is wrong to define a word by its (assumed) etymology; etymology has to do with the history of a word, not its meaning&amp;quot; (ibid, 39-40).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The usage of the word in 1 Timothy should drive our interpretation of this passage in 1 Corinthians 6:9, given there is a bit more to work off of in 1 Timothy with regards to deciphering the meaning of &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai.&lt;/em&gt; In 1 Tim 1:10, sexual slavery may have been the target of the apostle’s prohibition since “kidnappers” or “slave traders” is listed in the vice list directly after &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;. In 1 Timothy there are three terms that are most relevant: pornois (“sexually immoral”)), &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;andrapodistais&lt;/em&gt; (“kidnappers,” “slave traders”). Placed in a list such a this, it is suggestive against the traditional interpretation of &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai,&lt;/em&gt; and is evidence of a grouping of the sexually immoral, or prostitutes, or those who visit and/or use male prostitutes, or those who sexually exploit others for money (e.g., traffickers who kidnap and sell human beings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As K. Renato Lings in his book &lt;em&gt;Love Lost in Translation: Homosexuality and the Bible,&lt;/em&gt; 2013 points out, the usual Greek terms for two male lovers are &lt;em&gt;erastēs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;erōmenos&lt;/em&gt;, among others. In many instances these words talked about pederasty, but the other type of relationship would be between two equal partners, of which there is some literary evidence. In these cases erastēs and erōmenos would frequently be used, but Paul chose not use these words, but instead create his own word never used in ancient Greek literature before - &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;. This suggests that Paul is not addressing male &lt;em&gt;lovers&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, a more credible alternative is to view &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt; as a specific reference to men who practice abusive sex or commit economic exploitation, including theft and kidnapping young people of either sex into sexual slavery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sibylline Oracle 2.70-77 is one of the earliest appearances of the word &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitai&lt;/em&gt;. Although the exact date of this text is uncertain, it is probably independent from the NT. Here is the translation from J.J Collins: &amp;quot;Never accept in your hand a gift which derives from unjust deeds. Do not steal seeds. Whoever takes for himself is accursed (to generations of generations, to the scattering of life. Do not &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitein&lt;/em&gt;, do not betray information, do not murder. Give one who has labored his wage. Do not oppress a poor man. Take heed of your speech. Keep a secret matter in your heart. Make provision for orphans and widows and those in need. Do not be willing to act unjustly, and therefore do not give leave to one who is acting unjustly&amp;quot; (2:70-77). This text is likely an independent witness to an author coining this word from “arsen” and “koiten.&amp;quot; The original author was also Jewish, like Paul. The immediate passage the word &lt;em&gt;arsenokoitein&lt;/em&gt; is embedded in appears to be Jewish in origin, since it has no Christian parallels. For the Jewish origin of substratum of the second book of the Sibylline Oracles: see &amp;quot;The Sibylline Oracles,&amp;quot; in &lt;em&gt;The Literature of the Jewish People in the Period of the Second Temple and the Talmud, Volume 2 Jewish Writings of the Second Temple Period&lt;/em&gt;, by John J. Collins. The veat to this text is that it is embedded in interpolations. However, J.J. Collins argues: ‘nothing in these verses [2.56–148] is necessarily Christian.’ And according to Dale Martin, the term here is used in a list involving &amp;quot;economic sins,&amp;quot; actions related to economic injustice or exploitation: accepting gifts from unjust sources, extortion, withholding wages, oppressing the poor, theft of grain, etc. See Dale B. Martin, &lt;em&gt;Sex and the Single Savior: Gender and Sexuality in Biblical Interpretation,&lt;/em&gt; 2006, pp. 39-41. Rather, it refers to some kind of economic exploitation, probably by sexual means: rape or sex by economic coercion, prostitution, pimping, or something of the sort. This is may be independent evidence of a rarely used word (around Paul&amp;#39;s writing) not being used for same-sex actions universally, despite the conjunction of “arsenos” and “koiten.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Boswell writes, “It is extremely difficult to believe that if the word actually meant “homosexual” or “sodomite,” no previous or contemporary author would have used it in a way which clearly indicated this connection&amp;quot; (Boswell, &lt;em&gt;Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 345). Boswell lists Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, etc who all used words besides ἀρσενοκοίτης when talking about homosexuality. More importantly, Josephus and Philo, both Greek-speaking Jews who discussed Sodom and believed that it was punished for its homosexuality never used ἀρσενοκοίτης, Boswell also surveyed Christian authors and observed that this word was hardly ever used to describe same-sex actions (so John, Boswell, &lt;em&gt;Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century&lt;/em&gt;, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp. 342-50).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Paul doesn&amp;#39;t condemn same sex relations universally most likely in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Romans 1:26-27&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the word ἀδικίαν in Rom 1:18 should be rendered as “injustice.&amp;quot; As Sarah Ruden says, “there is nothing vague about it. It is about hurting people&amp;quot; (Sarah Ruden, &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt;, 69). So Romans 1:18-27 is not about loving relationships. In fact, the entirety of Romans 1:18-32 is about abusive relationships among the Gentiles, not loving ones. Arland J. Hultgren writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage falls within a section (18-32) about abusive relationships of all kinds, and that should inform ones reflection of these verses. In light of that, one must ask whether they speak unilaterally of all types of same-gender sexual relationships. That they speak of all non-abusive ones between persons of homosexual orientation (in modern understanding) can be legitably challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Arland J. Hultgren, &lt;em&gt;Paul&amp;#39;s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary&lt;/em&gt;, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011, pp. 102)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, There is no allusion to same sex relations between women in Romans 1:26, where Paul speaks of females. Instead, this is about Gentile women who offered themselves to men for anal sex. This is exactly how the text was interpreted during the first three or so hundred years of the early church (e.g.,  Clement of Alexandria [150–215 CE] and Augustine of Hippo [354–430 CE]). It was not until John Chrysostom (400 CE) that anyone misinterpreted Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women. What moves this interpretation from likelihood to near certainty are the arguments mustered up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15699/jbl.1381.2019.522595?seq=1&quot;&gt;this 2019 JBL article&lt;/a&gt; by David J. Murphy that offers further support for the notion that Paul is not referring to same-sex relations between women, but rather anal sex with men. Murphey in the article writes: &amp;quot;When χρῆσις refers to the act of intercourse, χρῆσις is assigned to the male, who is expected to penetrate the other and thus “use” that person—a woman, a boy, a male slave. It is no surprise that Fredrickson found no case in ancient Greek where one female is said to enjoy sexual χρῆσις of another female&amp;quot; (pp. 223). Murphy gives Fredrickson further support for this contention in his article. So &lt;strong&gt;in no instance&lt;/strong&gt; is the word Paul employs in Romans 1:26, χρῆσις (&amp;quot;use&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intercourse&amp;quot;), used to denote a female enjoying sexual &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; of another female within ancient Greek literature. &amp;quot;Rather, when it refers to the act of intercourse, χρῆσις is assigned to the male, who is expected to penetrate the other and thus “use” that person—a woman, a boy, a male slave&amp;quot; (ibid.). This argument from Murphy pretty much necessarily entails that sexual relations between women are not condemned in Romans 1 at all. So why would sexual relations between men be universally condemned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, some people read the homoeroticism in 1:27 back into 1:26. However, David J. Murphy writes: &amp;quot;Jamie Banister’s finding, however, has not been refuted—namely, that there is no contemporary parallel for a conjunctive ὁμοίως clause that operates backwards, so to speak, to provide clarification of an otherwise vague or ambiguous antecedent clause. On the contrary, all thirty-eight instances of ὁμοίως τε καί in TLG support Banister—that is, after an antecedent clause already understandable on its own, ὁμοίως introduces a clause whose argument is co-oriented with the previous clause’s argument. To read female homoeroticism back into 1:26 because we have male homoeroticism in the next verse is to reverse the way conjunctive ὁμοίως functions&amp;quot; (Murphy, David J. “More Evidence Pertaining to ‘Their Females’ in Romans 1:26.” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biblical Literature&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 138, no. 1, 2019, pp. 235-236).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, one has to note how Rom 1:26-27 starts off. The words that begin this passage are “for this reason&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;because of this&amp;quot; (Διὰ τοῦτο). That initial statement entails that the type of sexual behavior described in 1:26-27 is the &lt;em&gt;direct result&lt;/em&gt; of the type of idolatry described in the context in 1:22-25. The idolatry that is being described by Paul in 1 Rom 1:22-26 is the theriomorphic (something in the form of an animal) representation of the divine. Paul says that &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; portray God or their gods as animals, as birds, four-footed animals, or reptiles in Rom 1:23, and he repeats this notion once again in 1:25 when Paul says that they &amp;quot;worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator.&amp;quot; Then, in 1:26, Paul says that &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of this, these people were given over to behavior described. For this point, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146107915577097?journalCode=btba&quot;&gt;this 2015 article&lt;/a&gt; by Robert K. Gnuse. There were also many Roman cults that had &amp;quot;images resembling human beings&amp;quot; (cf. 1:23), such as that of Cybele and Bacchus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, understanding the temporal aspect of the verbs in Romans 1:26–27 is crucial for evaluating the views on sexual defiance that Paul appears to be expressing. The three key Greek verbs are all held in the &lt;strong&gt;past tense&lt;/strong&gt; indicating &lt;strong&gt;distant events.&lt;/strong&gt; If these verbs (paredōken, ‘gave them up’; metēllaxan, ‘exchanged’; exekauthēsan, ‘burned’; etc) are read properly, it seems suggestive (though is not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; the case) that Paul is referring to one or several incidents &lt;em&gt;in the past&lt;/em&gt; with which he assumes his Christian audience in Rome to be familiar, such as possibly sexual scandals in cults or elsewhere. This seems to point against the applicability of this passage to today&amp;#39;s day and age. So even if Paul is referring to some kind of homoerotic behavior, he is speaking of behavior that occurred in the past and were well known to the audience - so probably in cults in the region that committed sexual scandals. Some English translations change the verbs into present tense, thus changing the meaning of the text. The chapter finishes in the present tense to lash out at ‘foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless’ idolaters who continually practice vices and wickedness (1:30–31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixth, that said, verb tenses/aspects apart, the main concern is the very simplistic approach to the section 1:25-27 that so many Christian commentators adopt. And as commentators have noted, Paul is not talking about Christians at all in this particular part of the argument, but rather Gentiles (cf. Arland J. Hultgren, &lt;em&gt;Paul&amp;#39;s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary&lt;/em&gt;, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011, pp. 101-102). Paul&amp;#39;s words in Romans 8:1 is where his authentic theology shines through (&amp;quot;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventh, some point to &lt;em&gt;para physin&lt;/em&gt; (translated as &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot;) as proof that Paul condemned same-sex relations in Romans 1:26, since some Jewish authors used these words to (possibly) condemn same-sex relations universally. However,  the fact that in no instance does χρῆσις denote sexual relations between two women makes this point moot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the subject of homoeroticism, it appears as though certain group activities are discussed. A detailed analysis of the context shows that the main focus is on sexual excesses wrought &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; idolatrous practices. The polemic reflections in 1:18–32 are also inspired by the book of Wisdom and, additionally, seem to allude to scandalous events in the past associated with the Roman cults of deities or other places. It&amp;#39;s important to note that Paul’s letter to the Romans was written at a time in which Greek and Roman deities were widely worshipped in the Mediterranean region, making polytheism, or idolatry, a routine part of everyday life. In fact, in Paul&amp;#39;s day, 420 different temples to cults are reported to have been functioning in Rome itself (cf. K. Renato Lings, &lt;em&gt;Love Lost in Translation: Homosexuality and the Bible,&lt;/em&gt; 2013). See this 2011 JBL article for more support on this as well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/23488275?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents&quot;&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/23488275?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jude 7&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient Greek word in Jude 7 that is of interest is &lt;em&gt;apelthousai&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;they went after other flesh&amp;quot;). This crucial element in v. 7 is the notion of ‘other flesh’. Given the Greek wording, the traditional interpretation is ironic indeed. If one looks at the modern term ‘heterosexual’, it refers precisely to those who are attracted to the ‘other’ sex/flesh! So some kind of heterosexual sex seems to be in view here. See K. Renato Lings, &lt;em&gt;Love Lost in Translation: Homosexuality and the Bible,&lt;/em&gt; 2013 on this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum: Judges 19-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Boyarin writes: &amp;quot;In the story in Judges 19 the account is similar to the Sodom story . . . This is an absolutely horrifying story of violence toward women, and, while the men of Gibeah are punished terribly for their murder of the woman (20:4ff.), the Levite who threw her to the dogs to save his skin is let off scot-free by the text. A story of primitive male privilege of the most repulsive sort, this is not in any way, however, a discourse about homosexuality. Indeed, here, the acceptance of a “heterosexual” substitute shows that the people of Gibeah are not being anathematized as “homosexuals.” Their punishment is explicitly owing to their violence toward the woman and not to their supposed homoeroticism. In both of these stories we find, then, a representation, perhaps with some historical basis, of a tradition of aggression toward strangers, acted out as “homosexual” rape (and murder – the Levite expected that he was to be killed as well [20:5]). These accounts have nothing whatever to do with either legal or discursive practices related to same-sex desire&amp;quot; (Daniel Boyarin, &lt;em&gt;The Talmud - A Personal Take&lt;/em&gt;, Mohr Siebeck, 2018, pp. 140-141).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What About Jesus?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Jesus shared the contempt for same-sex relations found among Hellenistic Jews like Philo or Josephus, it would have been inconceivable that his encounter with the centurion would have occurred without at least an admonition to the centurion about his relationship with his &lt;em&gt;pais&lt;/em&gt; in Matthew 8:5–13//Luke 7:1–10 (cf. Neill 2009, pp. 215). Most scholars see a sexual element to the relationship between the centurion and his servant. While this is an argument from silence as well, if Matthew 19:5&amp;#39;s  silence on gay marriage is valid (which many Christians think), than so too is this argument. Besides, this argument is better, since Jesus literally does them a favor (heal the Centurion&amp;#39;s servant) and makes no mention of any wrongdoing, which Jesus does in other episodes. Other than this, there isn&amp;#39;t much to go off of. You&amp;#39;d think Jesus or the Gospel authors would make a mention of this topic if it was a sin? Plus. the bible may actually affirm same-sex relations, as I think it does (1 Sam 18:1-4; 20:17, 30-41; 23:18; 2 Sam 1:25-26; Ruth 1:14, 16-17; 4:15-17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appealing to what Jews believed pre-70 CE is irrelevant, because there was no unified Jewish belief pre-70 regarding same-sex relations! Christopher Zeichmann writes that Judaism &amp;quot;like most cultures throughout history, there were various attitudes toward same-sex intimacy, ranging from disgust to acceptance to eager participation&amp;quot; (Christopher B. Zeichmann, &lt;em&gt;Same-Sex Intercourse Involving Jewish Men 100BCE–100CE: Sources and Significance for Jesus’ Sexual Politics&lt;/em&gt;, Brill, 2020, pp. 15). There are  texts from Jewish authors (even those that disapprove of it like Josephus) that narrate same-sex relationships (A.J. 15.25-30; A.J. 16.230-232 = J.W. 1.488-489; J.W. 4.560–563), proving that such relations were embraced by at least some Jews. Pagan authors also accuse Jewish people of homoerotic relations (cf. Tacitus, &lt;em&gt;Hist.&lt;/em&gt; 5.5.1-2), and there is graffiti that likely show that same-sex relationships were accepted in some circles of Judaism (e.g., CIIP 3499). There is more as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t think many people on the english-speaking internet have any genuine reason to be concerned for their right to free speech - unless they&amp;#39;re being extremely racist, mysoginist, or any sort of hateful towards a minority or other. As a consequence, anytime anyone complains about being censored for &amp;quot;no reason&amp;quot; from a major site, I always assume they held some of those views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run into a shit load of hateful stuff that&amp;#39;s hugely normalized in every corner of the internet, completely unmoderated, and it boggles my mind that anyone would think online platforms are anywhere near out of control with their &amp;quot;censorship&amp;quot;. I undestand that it&amp;#39;s a power that should be kept in check, but right now if anything there &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t enough&lt;/em&gt; being done by online platforms to avoid being used as breeding grounds for fascist ideology for example, in my opinion, or pedophilia (though that&amp;#39;s being cracked down on more). As a consequence anyone who&amp;#39;s worried about their free speech genuinely being taken away is probably only saying that because what they actually have to say is pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if it was not 1:1, having the pay of government leaders be derived from the median income of the population that they work for would directly drive their interests in raising that metric as significantly as possible. Want a raise? Pursue one for your constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad to hear criticisms of this idea as it’s only a starting point, but I feel that it’s possible to find a structural basis that would decrease the pandering to special interests and benefit the population in a completely reasonable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will award a delta to anyone who can either offer a notable refinement of this idea or who can explain legitimately why it wouldn’t make politicians more interested in living wages than they currently are in our present system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’ve awarded deltas for points about long-term vs short-term focus and also for cost of living etc. I hear you all on the fact that many politicians don’t rely on their salary for their financial well-being, and I am already aware and agree with that observation. That said, I am not saying this idea would be a full solution to tie their self-interest to the benefit of their constituents but my CMV says that it would “help”. It’s hard to agree that across the board for all politicians that none of them care whatsoever about the money they make in their salaries. It might not be the primary source of income for many of them, but between all national and state government leaders not all of them are independently wealthy so I still believe that the impact would be greater than 0.&lt;/p&gt;

NO! The artists gets around NumberOfYourStreams * 0.00248€ (2,48 milli€)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Because all spotifymoney goes into one pot, where every creator get&amp;#39;s it money by streaming* market share.

&lt;p&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t spotify do something against clickfarms? No, because they are getting their 30% cut &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; they can say &amp;quot;we have X streams per month&amp;quot; (X is some very large number), which leads to an growth stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are protections for American freedoms in the constitution, that is only protection from the &lt;em&gt;government&lt;/em&gt; taking your freedoms. Meanwhile, capitalism and inequality are stripping your freedoms away, and there is nothing to protect you from that. Additionally, the freedoms protected by the constitution and bill of rights are not remarkably different to rights protections in many other western countries (save for 2A).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole idea that the USA is the &lt;em&gt;freest country in the world&lt;/em&gt; is just a nationalistic lie.&lt;/p&gt;

This one really grinds my gears and seeing if someone who knows more about the economics of the situation can change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UFC PPV is currently $70 for each event on top of 6 a month for ESPN plus. I think the rampant piracy of these fights are well known. I&amp;#39;d like to state my opinion that if a structure such as $30 per PPV fight or maybe a $150-200 year pass for all the PPVs would raise more money as it&amp;#39;s more palatable to a lot of people to pay for. My unsupported theory is that if this happened, for every purchaser of a 70 dollar PPV, you&amp;#39;d get at least 2 new people who&amp;#39;d be willing to pay 30 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: I&amp;#39;m salty I can&amp;#39;t go to bars anymore to pay for beer and food and watch the fights. 40 bucks doing that is more palatable than paying for the fight by myself or a couple friends for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for a possible solution, but I would love some criticism on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to start by saying a few things which influence why I think these changes would be good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, our current public school system is a glorified daycare service so parents are free to go to work. This may be more true in some areas compared to others, and I left private schools out of this equation because I honestly see that as a luxury service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, our academic system is surprisingly unregulated despite it being a government system. I think this was mostly a problem from the past. Books were as available as they could be, either because of how many were published, how much they cost, etc., but now we have the internet. We&amp;#39;ve seen roughly a year where students had zoom school. Books can be acquired online for free and easily, especially the classics. So I think this can accomplish a few things. Part 1 is that we no longer need to have physical schools. Zoom can accomplish what we want to accomplish or we could acquire something similar since it&amp;#39;s definitely not rocket science. Part 2 is that we can now have nationwide regulation on our schools curriculum. You could even have lecturers for masses of students to watch and review and then the numerous teachers across the states can focus on individual interaction instead of having a bunch of teachers trying to handle 50 some kids at a time. All of this with minimal or complete elimination of vehicles (might need some underprivileged families who would be bussed to a computer lab for &amp;#39;school&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and this is based on interactions with my father across multiple school districts as he is a school official, parents need to take responsibility for their children. This is more of a &amp;#39;in the home&amp;#39; problem. From what my father has told me, when a child does something wrong at school the parent doesn&amp;#39;t ask what the kid did, they ask what the school did to their child. Parents, over the years, have been transitioning to acting less like parents and more like a friend to their kids. This is obviously a vast generalization, as that mentality could also circle around to encouraging acting out at school since no real repurcussions come out at home. However a similar problem happened with Zoom school as students left at home would have various individual problems. Yet when a teacher would contact a parent, the parent wouldn&amp;#39;t take responsibility for that problem and insist the teacher is the problem. So this isn&amp;#39;t something we can solve so easily as just closing schools and saying &amp;#39;get on your computers at 8&amp;#39;. And while I have not reviewed all the cases, we did see a national drop in school test scores which I think could be solved via mass lecture and more individual interaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, we need to stop shunning our country colleges. Maybe this was just my experience, but my student advisor made it seem like community college was for either dropouts, the unwashed masses, or those who could barely pass the class. The prejudice against community college was palpable, but my advisor was also rather incompetent so maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t hold that against them (they helped me schedule grades 10th through 12th but managed to help me be short 1 year of science and math, so I had to take 2 years of science and math in my senior year. Not a fun time.) Anyway, community college isn&amp;#39;t all that advanced. I&amp;#39;m not saying this to disparage them, but that I think we can eliminate a fair bit of highschool courses, at least a year, and instead start community college online courses early. Give kids exposure to some trades so they aren&amp;#39;t forced to blindly jump into four year university like they are today. I honestly think we can make community college 100% free as well, and label 4 year University a luxury education. I&amp;#39;ve never had a job turn me away for lacking a 4year degree anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, some points against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, sports and other after school activities. Obviously we can&amp;#39;t have these online, even if esports is becoming a thing. The good ole football and whatnot still exists. I honestly think that communities can pick this up without a school being there to round the children up. Even back when I was in school in the 90&amp;#39;s we had soccer leagues and stuff outside school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, young children. I think anything in elementary school or younger (preschool through 4th grade) will likely still have to have in school learning. They are too young and undisciplined to get on the computer and stay there without cartoons after mom and dad leave for work. Plus various other things like younger kids needing some help with the toilet and whatnot. So we still need that 1/3rd plus of our physical education system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Health/PE. This is obviously something that can rather difficult to do over Zoom. Health could probably be done, because it&amp;#39;s relaying info, but you lack the Physical of the Education. This is something, I think, that we Americans have to step up to the plate for. We&amp;#39;re globally ridiculed as the obese nation and not without excessive evidence. We demand governed provided healthcare but we can&amp;#39;t be bothered to take care of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, and lastly from my point of view, this is obviously a massive infrastructure change and leave a lot of unused land and resources. Old school building are seen as community heritage, especially in small towns. So just bulldozing them is going to be heavily resisted, especially with the cost of putting them up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible solution, although a suboptimal one imo, would be to have the schools become the new community centers. Plus you can reuse the schools computer labs for the children who are unable to access them at home. This is going to leave a lot of excess room, which is why I see it as suboptimal. You could probably get away with just keeping the highschools and elementary schools (because grades pre-K-4). The schools can also still be used for the community sports (Gymnasiums, fields, etc). So reusing old infrastructure is not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know there are going to be a lot more problems than there are benefits to a system change like this. Change always brings more problems than solutions. Especially when the changes are bigger and broader. So I warmly welcome insights and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is that birds are meant to fly and spread their wings. It’s a basic need for birds and what they’re meant to do. It breaks my heart seeing birds in cages as pets because it’s nothing like their natural habitat. It would be like us being confined to a small living room, or more bluntly, a jail cell for all to watch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own pet birds or disagree, I would greatly appreciate your input so that I can feel less distress due to my current view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that ain&amp;#39;t me chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here to talk to you today about the extensively documented benefits to your physiological and psychological well being that can be accomplished through various meditation practices and breathing techniques, whilst also presenting an argument for why I believe these techniques should form a vital part of the high school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, some quick facts about me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m studying for a doctorate in Neuroscience, my specialty is Neurodevelopmental disorders though. So the qualification is only vaguely relevant here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve struggled with depression, anxiety and a host of other mental health issues exasperated by the stress bought on by academic expectation for much of my adolescent and early adult life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In combination with therapy, medication and other positive lifestyle changes, meditation has proved invaluable to my mental well being and ability to excel academically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets get into the science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has confirmed a myriad of health benefits associated with the practice of meditation.

&lt;p&gt;Fairly conclusive then, I think we can agree. So now that we&amp;#39;ve cleared up how effective it can be, let&amp;#39;s address the issue of teaching it to students in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like a waste of time and money right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, we already teach physical education to students and I really hope I don&amp;#39;t have to explain to you how beneficial exercise can be for physical and psychological well being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s too complicated for kids though, surely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all, in fact basic breathing techniques and meditation practices couldn&amp;#39;t be any easier to start, here are some lovely British doctors teaching you one you can try right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/breathing-exercises-for-stress/&quot;&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/breathing-exercises-for-stress/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is a quick and easy guide to simple meditation practices that don&amp;#39;t require any experience whatsoever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/&quot;&gt;https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is simply a practice of mindfulness and observation. There are many different methods and schools you can practice but even a beginner, with no experience or guidance can take an hour out of their day, sit quietly and comfortably with their eyes closed, observe their breathing and seek awareness of their natural state of physiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a vital life skill that we all should learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your academic years are some of the most stressful, painful and challenging years of your life. We should be carefully guiding young people through these times and teaching them skills to help them manage the stress and emotional weight that will otherwise almost certainly scar them in countless ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple breathing techniques and meditation practices form a key part of this, as part of a revised curriculum geared towards addressing the mental health crisis young people are facing - we need to start teaching this in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been (future) Dr. Yasmin and thank you for coming to my TedX talk, one day they&amp;#39;ll give me a real Ted talk I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about it? Why shouldn&amp;#39;t meditation and breathing techniques form a part of the high school curriculum?&lt;/p&gt;

Granted the VA isn&amp;#39;t always great necessarily, but it feels &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; to walk out of the hospital after an appointment without ever seeing a cash register when it would have cost me potentially thousands of dollars otherwise. It&amp;#39;s something that I don&amp;#39;t think just veterans should be able to experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/new-poll-shows-canadians-overwhelmingly-support-public-health-care/&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/07/591128836/u-k-hospitals-are-overburdened-but-the-british-love-their-universal-health-care&quot;&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; seem to overwhelmingly love their public healthcare. I dated a Canadian woman for two years who was probably more on the conservative side for Canada, and she could absolutely not understand how Americans allow ourselves to go broke paying for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more wealthy opponents might continue to oppose it, because they can afford healthcare out of pocket if they need to. However, I&amp;#39;m referring to the middle class and under who simply cannot afford huge medical bills and yet continue to oppose a public system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time i see a post from that sub it is something along the lines of &amp;quot;there are no good men left&amp;quot; or just trashing men. Now i get it, there are some fucking animals out there who should be left beaten and bloodied in a ditch for what they&amp;#39;ve done to women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you&amp;#39;re not going to find many allies like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pick apart their high value man list for a moment, and i&amp;#39;ll give my 2 cents on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that is respectful, loyal and faithful. - this is a given, i&amp;#39;d expect the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A giving man that pays for dates and a relatively higher proportion of expenses in the relationship - the classic cake and eat it too. We usually pay for the date. I&amp;#39;d say if a guy brings up the idea of &amp;quot;lets both pay our way&amp;quot; before the date it should be discussed because, and  to be honest, I can see why someone would do this. I&amp;#39;ve been saddled with rediculous bills before at high end places (still paid, but never trying to talk to those folks again) and occasionally will ask to do things like this if i suspect i&amp;#39;m going to be paying 30 for my food and drink and 130 for theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for at the relationship stage, it&amp;#39;s whoever makes more pays more. If i was making less than my SO i&amp;#39;d expect them to take up the slack. If i wasn&amp;#39;t paying, i&amp;#39;d do the housework, mind the kids, run errands, etc. A relationship is a 2 way street, both sides have to give equally for things to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that is confident, consistent and reliable - again i&amp;#39;d want the same in any partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that listens to what you say and tries his best to do as you ask - only if the same is reciprocated. Otherwise that sounds a lot like a master slave relationship and while i don&amp;#39;t judge the lyfestyle, youre going to chase off a lot of guys with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man with a good, sustainable job - ok, you too sweetheart. You don&amp;#39;t want to date a freeloader, neither do we. Don&amp;#39;t quit your career because you&amp;#39;re now in a relationship, that&amp;#39;s lazy. Different story once kids are involved, someone has to care for em, but if you have nothing holding you back from having a job, why not? Helps ease the bills and you then aren&amp;#39;t needing to rely on others financially. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that appreciates you and shows you that he loves you - another &amp;quot;relationships 101&amp;quot; category&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsible man that keeps his word - again, i&amp;#39;d expect the same from my SO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that takes care of his body, his face and his physical appearance - yet if we ask the same we get yelled at for being sexist. You want that, expect a similar requirement in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man that cares about your sexual pleasure and goes down on you regularly without being asked - again, flip the script and it&amp;#39;s sexist. Here&amp;#39;s a better idea, how about both sides set their limits on what they&amp;#39;ll do and talk about it like adults, i&amp;#39;m bi and honestly would rather deepthroat a dick than eat a chick out because of some unfortunate events in bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in having children, an attentive, responsible father and caretaker - again this is something that both parties have to sit down and discuss like adults instead of relying on the idea of what should happen. A kid is a massve change in your life, and requires effort from both parties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, FDS is mostly just new wave feminist &amp;quot;men are evil&amp;quot; rhetoric wrapped up in &amp;#39;we are protecting ourselves&amp;quot; and a whole lot of echo chamber. You ladies want to talk about what is actually causing the problems you&amp;#39;re trying to solve? Well look no further than FDS is. Incels came about because of their echo chambers, and i see FDS going down a similar route of turning into a hateful cesspit of an echo chamber where the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; is demonized and playing the victim is the norm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now i realize i&amp;#39;m coming off as pretty ignorant right now but i&amp;#39;m not saying things are perfect the way they are. What i&amp;#39;m saying is that bulding yourself an echo chamber is wrong. What i&amp;#39;m saying is &amp;quot;all men are trash&amp;quot; is essentially the flipside of a guy sying &amp;quot;all women are whores&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s like the old bit of dating advice &amp;quot;if everyone you go out with is complete garbage, perhaps it&amp;#39;s time to take a look in the mirror.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing gets acomplished by talking amongst one side of a problem. Discussion is needed, and comprimise is needed. You get there by respecting the other side like you would your own, not by screaming at them that they are the problem because that is just an attempt to put your own flaws out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, change my views here. I&amp;#39;m hoping i&amp;#39;m just reading this sub wrong, but i&amp;#39;m having a hard time interpreting it any other way without getting some outside perspective. I&amp;#39;m currently at work and this is my first cmv post, so bear with me if i don&amp;#39;t reply immidiately. Also, i&amp;#39;ll be putting a bit more faith behind replies coming from women on this one. No offence guys, please still chime in, but i&amp;#39;m rather interested in what the &amp;quot;other side&amp;quot; of this mess&amp;#39; perspective is.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the political equivalent of making everything about yourself and not giving a damn about the needs of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When libertarians speak about the problems they see, these problems &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; tie back to themselves in a significant way. Taxes is the biggest one, and the complaint is &amp;quot;my taxes are too high&amp;quot;, meaning that the real problem here is essentially just &amp;quot;I am not rich enough&amp;quot;. It really, truly does not matter what good, if any, that tax money is doing; what really matters is that the libertarian could have had $20,000 more this year to, I dunno, buy even more ostentatious things? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contrast this with other political ideologies, like people who support immigration and even legalizing undocumented immigrants which may even harm some native citizens but is ultimately a great boon for the immigrants themselves. Or climate change, an issue that affects the entire planet and the billions of people outside of our borders and often requires us to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. I&amp;#39;ve never met a single libertarian who gave a damn about either, because why care about some brown people outside of your own borders or who are struggling so much that they abandoned everything they knew just to make an attempt at a better life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the libertarian will ever care about a political issue that doesn&amp;#39;t make himself rich in some way. Anything not related to personal wealth, good luck getting a libertarian to give a single shit about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong there might be appropriate times to use these words to describe something, but I really wish that people would step back a bit, learn about the history and terminology and then use a bit of damn nuance to apply them accurately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, why would anyone support a system in which your vote doesn’t count toward the outcome unless you support the candidate who wins the popular majority in your state — or in the case of Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who wins the majority in each congressional district?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 48 “winner-take-all” states, all of the electoral votes are awarded to the candidate who wins the majority of individual votes in that state. So, for example, if you’re a Republican in Massachusetts or Vermont, your vote for president is meaningless because your state is reliably blue and all of its electoral votes can be counted on to go to the Democratic candidate. You might as well stay home. Same for Democrats who vote for president in reliably red states like the Dakotas, Kansas, and West Virginia. Under the current system, you might just as well skip it. No wonder voter turnout in U.S. presidential elections rarely cracks the 55% mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine the alternative under a national popular vote. Presidential candidates crisscrossing all 50 states in 2024. The Republican ticket barnstorming liberal New England. Democrats rallying in places like the Dakotas, Mississippi, and Kansas. No more battleground states. Every vote counts toward the outcome. And the winner of the national popular vote is guaranteed to be awarded 270 electoral votes and the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to the “winner-take-all” rules of the States, the votes of 4 out of 5 Americans for the President don’t matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whichever candidate gets the most votes in your state gets&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the Electoral College votes from your state (unless you live in Nebraska or Maine). That means that,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;if you didn’t vote for the winner in your state, your vote doesn’t matter to the Electoral College.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electoral college should be abolished and the person with the popular vote should be the next president. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change my view as to why certain votes should be worth less (or even worthless) depending on which state you live in.&lt;/p&gt;

I consume sex work myself in the internet as does almost every man. However I don’t consume sex work in real life as this is heavily looked down upon. I have had multiple girlfriends tell me they wouldn’t stay with me if I consumed sex work and I believe this to be an even more pervasive judgment today than the opposite (where men wouldn’t date ex-sex workers). As a result I believe that we should stop shaming sex consumers to be fair to both sides of the equation and to destigmatize the entire industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the stigma comes from a place of seeing men who “need” to “resort” to sex work as being low value or desperate and unable to get sex the normal way. This leads to a self fulfilling prophecy and to customers that are unattractive and potentially dangerous so in getting rid of this stigma we would also be improving the working lives of sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;

IMO Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, and most major fast food chains all have better tasting black coffee than Starbucks. The fact that Starbucks is the worldwide leader in coffee shop market share would lead people to believe that their standard unadorned coffee was near the tastiest or best of the bunch, but this doesn’t appear to be true from my experience or from any opinion polls I’ve seen. As a company, Starbucks makes far more money if every coffee order is something more complicated than a standard cup of coffee.

&lt;p&gt;I do not be any means endorse, advocate for, or otherwise support in any way eugenics in action or thought. Eugenics is a stain on humanities history and always leads to evil.  This post isn&amp;#39;t a nod or call of action to eugenics or its philosophy in any way. The state fundamentally shouldn&amp;#39;t have the right to sterilize or otherwise control the procreation of individuals based on &amp;quot;desired&amp;quot; genetic traits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I personally feel that if you are someone that has some sever genetic disorder you simply shouldn&amp;#39;t procreate. I am talking about genetic disorders like severe autism, Huntington&amp;#39;s, dwarfism, and severe cystic fibrosis. Namely, any inheritage genetic disorders that greatly impacts and detracts from your life, often reducing your life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe these individuals shouldn&amp;#39;t be parents, in fact I think the opposite. There are countless foster children stuck in some terrible home just hoping they will be adopted. They are typically there at no fault of their own. Why not simply adopt one of these children and give them a full life instead of having a child you know is going to suffer greatly needlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely understand why any adult would want to bring a child into the world that carries their own genes, but certainly there comes a point when you overcome that urge and understand you got dealt a shitty hand. Its not fair, but why inflict that onto a new being when you could take a foster child and love them as your own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I would like to clarify this includes individuals that do not show the genetic disorder themselves, but are certain they will have a child that will inherit that disorder. For example, this post also applies to perfectly the average couple that knows their genetic child would have a severe disability like severe autism. This is more about choosing to produce children you know will have these severe disabilities over enriching and loving someone through adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

For these reason Kids shouldn’t be allowed in churches or religious schools. They aren’t inteligent enough to understand  god, they literally believe in santa. When they grow up a bit more ( middle/high school) I think they should be introduced to all the main religions as well as atheist and agnostic views so that they can decide which goes better with their values. I know that religion is really helpful for some people but it’s also harmful to others and everyone should be granted the right to decide what to believe. 
I don’t think someone who’s been “educated” on just one religon has ability to decide what to believe in. 
I used to be anti religious for personal reasons and anger but now, I see how religion has a positive impact on those who are suffering because it takes away the responsability of our life. However I still think that you shouldn’t force this onto your kid because beliefs are not always true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years. For an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is too long of copyright term in my opinion. My view is to replace this excessive copyright term (which is not trademark, so Mickey Mouse is a trademark owned by Disney and can&amp;#39;t be used in new content that infringes on their trademark)  with 28 year term, which can be renewed upon but each 28 years will incur 33% of all revenue from the the copyright material. The copyrighted material will enter the public domain after 84 years or when the copyright owner decides to relinquish their property into public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years 0-28 0%Years 29-56 33% gross revenue taxedYears 57-84 66% gross revenue taxedYears 85+ Public domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one cannot recoup and generate profit enough to incentivize creating the copyrighted material (ie the Constitutional purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause&quot;&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;) then the material wasn&amp;#39;t commercially successful which is not an entitlement that anyone should expect, just a limited &amp;quot;exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries&amp;quot;. The point of copyright has never been to maximize profits, regardless of contemporary revisionism to claim otherwise. If market forces sets a ceiling to revenue generated from content within the first 28 years to be X, then the copyright holder&amp;#39;s desire to have X be X+∞ (that&amp;#39;s infinity BTW) then that doesn&amp;#39;t give a valid reason to extended copyright until revenue is reached to achieve X+∞. Letting content enter public domain  is natural course for copyrighted material, and beneficial to wider society while concentration of content for perpetuity denies the public whose government has been enforcing the copyright law to the profit of the copyright holder. This compromise between eliminating copyright altogether or simply setting the maximum copyright term to be 14-20 years and the current seemingly never ending and ever extended copyright terms, that copyright owners are able to keep their copyright if they want but at an increasing cost that pays back to the government that enforces the copyright both here and abroad through treaties and trade organizations on the least revenue generating years for copyright material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would change my view if a better alternative copyright regime or reform, that maintained copyright but not forever as it seems like today. Defense of an interminable copyright, just extending it over and over again and not allowing any material into the public domain will be directly fail at changing my mind; I seeking an improvement to the status quo and not simply reflexly defend the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

If a man removes a condom mid-sex without the knowledge (and/or approval) of his partner, that should be punished. If a woman lies about being on birth control and has sex with a man, she deserves to be punished. Same applies if she claims that she&amp;#39;s already pregnant, when she isn&amp;#39;t. If a woman has previously taken birth control pills and then decides to stop taking them, she should be legally obliged to tell her sexual partner(s) about it before having sex with them again, if she has previously told them that she&amp;#39;s on birth control. Same applies for a man who decides to reverse his vasectomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinion applies even if they don&amp;#39;t result in a pregnancy or an STD. Of course it has to be &lt;strong&gt;proven&lt;/strong&gt; that there was deception, because pregnancies can still happen even with birth control.

I like to think most topics are nuanced (hence why I&amp;#39;m posting it here), but I really have a hard time seeing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; nuance with this one. Here is my reasoning, and I&amp;#39;ll try to outline what arguments I&amp;#39;ve heard that do not and probably won&amp;#39;t convince me of anything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cats a domesticated species. I hear people say they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;half-wild&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;less domesticated&amp;quot;, etc - but the type of cat that we as humans keep as a pet is literally a unique domesticated species. They depend on us for food, shelter, and healthcare. Ferals obviously exist, but their quality of life is poor comparatively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going off of point 1, cats are not a naturalized species around the world. When allowed outdoors, they are an invasive species. Most wildlife around the world has not had the time to evolve in tandem with exposure to cats, and as such, cats continue to pose a huge threat to wildlife. In New Zealand, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_New_Zealand&quot;&gt;cats are responsible for extinction of 6 bird species and 70 other species of wildlife.&lt;/a&gt; From a purely ecological standpoint, it&amp;#39;s extremely irresponsible to allow an invasive predator to freely hunt where you live - especially considering they often hunt and kill for fun, even when well fed, and even when wearing collars with bells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats. To name a few: dogs, other cats, raccoons, hawks, owls, skunks, foxes, cars, asshole humans, traps, rat poison, toxic plants, disease, etc. Even if your specific region doesn&amp;#39;t have one or two random threats, there is nowhere people live that is free of threats to cats. As a pet owner, your responsibility is to provide a safe, healthy environment for them. Letting them free-roam lets them come in contact with any number of potential risks for injury, disease, and death.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outdoor cats have a lower life expectancy than indoor cats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are plenty of ways to provide your cat enrichment indoors and/or give them safe, supervised outdoor time (catios, leashed walking, etc) without compromising their health and wellbeing. I&amp;#39;m not advocating for &amp;quot;keeping them locked in a house with nothing to do&amp;quot; - I think cats need playtime and enrichment, but that people taking the easy way out by letting them roam is lazy and irresponsible for the above reasons.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dogs also need enrichment and outdoor time, but for the most part, we don&amp;#39;t let them free-roam neighborhoods and cities like we do cats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that many people have the idea that cats are low-input pets who need little to nothing from them, which perpetuates neglect and poor welfare for them. Instead of challenging these ideas, we keep just putting them outside in the name of their enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also add that this post isn&amp;#39;t about barn cats - I am separately critical of them (as a farmer), but this is about pet cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMV? I know I laid out a lot here, but I am genuinely interested if there are reasons with merit out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*** EDIT: To clarify a couple points: I&amp;#39;m specifically talking about &lt;em&gt;free roaming&lt;/em&gt; outdoors, not about things where you let the cat on the porch for a few minutes and they don&amp;#39;t go any further, supervised outdoor time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m less compelled by arguments that nitpick at a particular risk (they&amp;#39;re examples of an overarching issue), more interested in hearing reasons as to why it is &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; to let cats free-roam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lane asked Chauvin three times if Floyd should be rolled over to his side or repositioned in concern for his health and persisted despite being the only officer to speak up. Chauvin dismissed these concerns reassured that he would be fine. Lane also volunteered to ride along in the ambulance and assisted with CPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to watch the video and say what he should have done in &lt;strong&gt;hindsight&lt;/strong&gt;. Lane absolutely could have done more, but he did not know at the time that Floyd was going to die. I believe almost anyone else in his position would have done the same or less. If Lane had physically intervened, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; Floyd would be alive and this would have never made the news, but Lane would have been hit with severe retribution, likely losing his job for assaulting a superior officer, and Chauvin would still be on the police force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that he was a rookie, that Chauvin was a superior officer (and a training officer) he was subordinate to, and that his peers did not share his dissent do not necessarily serve as an excuse for his actions or inactions, but are important factors in considering what any other reasonable person would do in his shoes in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Lane should receive more slack than the other two officers to send a message that speaking up at the very least will be a better result than not doing anything besides following orders. It could be said that a message still needs to be sent that no one would be able to escape consequences, but this can still be achieved by applying a sentence somewhere in between acquittal and that of the other two cops.&lt;/p&gt;

Derek Chauvin deserves to rot in prison example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out the way. When I look at the Makiyah Bryant situation, this is an example of us as a community needing to hold ourselves accountable. First of all WE NEED TO DEESCALATE SITUATIONS. Everyone is saying oh that police need better deeescalation, and that officer should have tried to deescalate before shooting. How about we do that ourselves? Why didn&amp;#39;t her parents who were right there deescalate the situation? There appears to have been other adults there as well. None of them tried to stop the violence either. Why didn&amp;#39;t her parents make her go back inside and wait for the police? Why didn&amp;#39;t her dad when she saw the police show up attempt to disarm his own daughter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t expect the police to come in and magically resolve all of our disputes. We need to learn to do that ourselves. Because when the police show up, their first priority is stopping whatever immediate threat there is regardless of the backstory, or what happened prior. If you are going to attempt murder in front of a cop, you have to accept that they will stop you be any means necessary. If you don&amp;#39;t like the outcomes then let&amp;#39;s stop forcing cops to make split second life or death decisions on our behalf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: It should have never gotten to the point where that young girl was attempting to stab/kill someone. This should have been stopped and deescalated long before that officer had to deal with it. And until we take responsibility for our own actions, this won&amp;#39;t be the last time something like this happens&lt;/p&gt;

The intent here is clear: to portray this as another incident of police brutality and systemic racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, shooting Makiyah Bryant was justified. She was lunging for another woman on the ground while swinging a kitchen knife. This is not the same as cops pepper spraying a black child a while back; Bryant was brandishing a lethal weapon with malicious intent. This is not the same as the cop who fired a handgun instead of a taser to detain a wanted man; an innocent citizen’s life was clearly in danger. And this is not the same as the cop who shot Adam Toledo; Bryant did not receive unclear instructions and was about to murder a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race and age of the victim make this all the more unfortunate, but claiming that this is a result of systemic racism or is an example of police brutality is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

According to certain people, you&amp;#39;re supposed to ask everyone for their pronouns shortly after meeting them. This is dumb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argument 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the motivation for this way of thinking is misplaced. People get upset at the idea of someone purposefully using the wrong pronouns as an insult, and they want to emphasize that this is offensive. For this reason, someone came up with the idea that you should ask everyone for their pronouns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there&amp;#39;s a difference between using the wrong pronouns as an insult, and incorrectly guessing someone&amp;#39;s pronouns. In the first instance, the person is trying to offend you. In the second instance, they&amp;#39;re just making an honest mistake. You shouldn&amp;#39;t get angry at the person making a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fly into an emotional fit because someone mistakenly used the wrong pronouns, then you&amp;#39;re being unreasonable. That&amp;#39;s a silly thing to get upset about. By all means, feel free to get offended if someone is trying to insult you by using different pronouns than you prefer. But, don&amp;#39;t freak out on a good-natured person because they made a mistake. That just makes you look emotionally unstable. Simply correct them. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argument 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may argue that trans people are emotionally fragile. We need to be extra delicate with our use of pronouns because a trans person might become an emotional wreck if the wrong pronoun is used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first response is that if you think this, then you&amp;#39;re really babying trans people. You&amp;#39;re also counteracting the narrative that they&amp;#39;re just regular people with one unique characteristic. You&amp;#39;re acting like they&amp;#39;re unhinged. Unless someone is being purposefully insulting, a regular person is not going to freak out if the wrong pronoun is used. If we need to tip toe around pronouns for fear of freaking out trans people, then that makes them seem like lunatics. I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the message people are trying to spread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second response would be that its possible for people to be sensitive about all sorts of issues. Some people are afraid of dogs. Should I refrain from mentioning my dog for fear that someone might have a dog phobia? Should I delicately ask someone if they have any animal phobias before bringing up the subject of pet ownership? Obviously, that would be unreasonable. So, why are we taking so many pains not to upset people with gender triggers? Why aren&amp;#39;t we taking the same pains not to upset people with other triggers? Why is it ok to mention medical issues, considering that some people are squeamish about that subject? Why aren&amp;#39;t we asking everyone to give us a list of emotional subjects before proceeding with a conversation? Why is gender the one issue so sensitive that we must not proceed with conversation before polling everyone? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, my title states that we should assume people&amp;#39;s gender in &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; situations. Admittedly, there are some situations in which that might be less appropriate. For instance, you might wish to ask someone for their gender if they have an androgynous appearance. Its a reasonable question if someone is presenting in a way which indicates that they might not simply be a straight cis person. Depending on your social circles, the majority of people you meet will not fall in that category. That&amp;#39;s why I say you should assume people&amp;#39;s gender in &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think that most ardent proponents of verifying everyone&amp;#39;s gender are typically not trans themselves. I&amp;#39;ve never seen a trans person freak out over mistaken use of the wrong pronouns. I tend to assume that most people are relatively calm and reasonable, be they cis, trans, straight, or gay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, the unreasonable people are typically keyboard warriors who are getting offended on someone else&amp;#39;s behalf. I think these people tarnish trans people by spreading the idea that they&amp;#39;re hyper sensitive lunatics who might freak out over grammar mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, if you enter a conversation asking about pronouns, I think most people are going to worry that you are hypersensitive. Its just going to make everyone think they have to tip toe around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a democratic socialist leaning towards social democrat, I do believe that Marx had some very good points and ideas (dialectical materialism for one), but I also believe that his proposed way of transitioning to communism is unrealistic, outdated, and has too many issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now to the opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When having discussions of socialism/communism people will often bring up the &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; revolutions/&lt;strong&gt;attempts&lt;/strong&gt; and whatnot such as Venezuela, USSR, Maoist China, Vietnam, ect... They usually follow the same sentiment as the following quote from right wing anti communist economist Thomas Sowell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are two issues with this, firstly being that this is a gross overgeneralization of extremely complex scenarios, and secondly that basically &lt;strong&gt;every major change ever for the better was attempted and failed hundreds of times before it succeeded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will focus on the second thing but if you wish to discuss the first I&amp;#39;d be happy to hear responses to that as well :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost every major change ever, there have been countless revolutions or attempts to make that change. Throughout all of history leaders, and people led wars/revolutions/major disruptions have failed, succeeded, and then failed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many failed revolutions that attempted to overthrow feudalism in medieval Europe unsuccessfully, there have been countless revolutions to try and establish democracy, to overthrow monarchies, ect....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Greece is held up as the original example of shining democracy, however their democracy eventually failed and it can be questioned whether or not it actually was a true democracy because only men (and certain men at that) could vote. With Rome, they went back and forth very commonly and made many attempts to change it back to a republic during.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another shocking example is that of slave revolutions, since the beginning of slavery, there have been countless rebellions. In pro-slavery America alone there were 250 failed rebellions. And this goes all the way to Rome when Spartacus led a major rebellion (I am sure there are ones before that but I cannot find them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there might be other critiques of communism/socialism that are valid and can be offered, it is silly in the big picture to bring up the amount of failed revolutions. Would you go back in time after the 40th peasant revolution against feudalism or monarchy and tell them to give up? Would you go and tell every slave and abolitionist, or civil rights or equality supporter that they should give up because they many have tried before them and failed? If the answer is no, as I believe for most rational people it would be, then I believe you agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

The writing process for a mainstream dance track is the same as it is for, say, a classical track: start by composing a chord progression, write and play a melody, add accompaniment, write vocals (if applicable,) design and add extra sounds, then mix and master the track.

Some may think race should be included in this, but I don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m not sure why, maybe because the stories I&amp;#39;ve read (featuring black or black-coded characters) have in some way centred around race and so it adds to the story. I guess as a white person I have that privilege. Anyway, this isn&amp;#39;t about race. Knowing a character&amp;#39;s race in advance wouldn&amp;#39;t put me off, and what I&amp;#39;m about to explain below isn&amp;#39;t something I&amp;#39;ve found (in my experience) to occur in relation to race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first line of a summary is that a bisexual girl with ADHD enters a realm and- Whatever follows doesn&amp;#39;t really matter. The thing you want your audience to know is that your character isn&amp;#39;t straight, and they&amp;#39;re neurodiverse. These aren&amp;#39;t bad things, but if they&amp;#39;re your selling points then it tells me you haven&amp;#39;t got much more to follow - that your goal wasn&amp;#39;t to write a story, but to get something - anything - out there which is representative. This applies to gender, it applies to religion, sexuality and ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, in an age where self-publication is a thing I guess it works. But, books can be tagged as LGBT (for example) without knowing in advance who it relates to and people seem to forget this (or, as I say, haven&amp;#39;t written anything good enough for the information to be omitted). Same goes for the other groups I listed (except perhaps disability, but there are ways to say things without it just being a dull, monotonous list). As I say, getting character information in advance tells me nothing good. Especially if it isn&amp;#39;t relevant to the plot. If it&amp;#39;s just a detail then you&amp;#39;re either a) trying to &amp;#39;profit&amp;#39; (not necessarily in monetary terms) off an identity, condition or &amp;#39;disorder&amp;#39;, etc, or b) it&amp;#39;s really all you&amp;#39;ve thought about and even you can&amp;#39;t find anything that makes your book otherwise interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to meet characters gradually, and get to know them as I get to know their narrative. If it&amp;#39;s being spoon-fed before I&amp;#39;ve even turned a page then the chances are it really isn&amp;#39;t worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: It would be superb if people had more examples which were novels, rather than TV or Film. TV and Film are marketed differently - trailers exist to add details, and so summaries do not stand alone. Consequently, such examples don&amp;#39;t really serve to contest my view.&lt;/p&gt;

Employee wages should not be subsidized with tips, employees should just but paid fair wages to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed this trend over the last few years where food shops that only offer counter service have been asking for tips. Places like donut shops, frozen yogurt shops (this one really irks me because you get your food yourself), and coffee shops now ask for tips at the register. I’ve only noticed this at places that have fancy point of sale systems where there’s a touchscreen facing the customer and they sneak in a little tip screen at the end of the transaction. Tipping at the table at restaurants is one thing, but these places ask you to tip while the person you’re supposed to be tipping is watching you make your selection. It’s incredibly awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I have with this is that at these places, the employee is providing me with a service for about a minute at the most. They grab my donuts, hand me my bag, then ring me up. Why are you asking for an extra $3 for 60 seconds worth of work? At least at sit down restaurants your server is helping you for a significant amount of time. They’re taking your order, bringing you drinks, providing a line of communication between you and the kitchen, bringing your food out, fixing any errors the kitchen made, all while you’re sitting down and having a good time with your family or friends.

&lt;p&gt;I’m having a kid soon, and some of the people in the groups are off their rocker. Most recently, someone posted about naming their baby boy “Anakyn.” They SPECIFICALLY put in their post (and I quote) “we know and have considered all of the possible teasing that could happen and we’re OK with the name regardless.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like wayyyyy too many people name their kids based on what THEY want, to feel cool and special, without any regard for how it will affect their child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, CMV: why should parents not be shamed for naming their kids something they KNOW they will be teased about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence, or the threat of violence, is punished more harshly when there is more weight behind it. For instance, the difference between simple battery and aggravated battery generally includes the use of a deadly weapon, even if the injury sustained by the victim is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of on-duty police officers have the implicit backing of the state, which has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. In the same way that it is worse to commit a crime with a deadly weapon than it is to commit that same crime without one, it is also worse to commit a crime while leveraging the power of the state than it is to commit the same crime without leveraging that power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I therefore believe that violent crimes such as assault, battery, manslaughter, and murder that are committed by on-duty police officers should carry increased punishments. For instance, an on-duty police officer who commits second degree murder might be subjected to the same range of sentences as a non- (or off-duty) police officer who committed first degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;

What people do in their free time outside of work to unwind is none of their business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta 8 THC is now legal and sold in Georgia and Virginia is legalizing everything this July. I truly don&amp;#39;t understand why alcohol is something they don&amp;#39;t test for but weed is.. Is it because weed isnt &lt;em&gt;federally&lt;/em&gt; legal? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do employers think people who smoke outside of work will come back less intelligent, less capable, and less productive when they come back to work &lt;strong&gt;sober&lt;/strong&gt;? Can anything be proven to justify the fairness and support the continuation of THC drug testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is more dangerous than weed and actually kills people by disease or from physical accidents due to being drunk. We all know this is a fact. Lots of employees are borderline alcoholics yet nobody bats an eye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are battling chronic pain, extreme depression or anxiety and cannabis helps those people including myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to go through a long period where I want to take my own life and I have to deal with very bad insomnia just so I can get &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; enough to pass a drug test to get a job in the field I went to college for. That isnt fair. Its hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weed should be legal everywhere and be treated exactly the same as alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you imagine if epmloyers did long term urine tests or hair tests for alcohol? Nobody would get jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

Something along the lines of “well x country does this so you should be grateful or change your perspective.” Not only do I disagree, but I want to focus on America and it’s shortcomings. Not comparing it to another country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t count the amount of times I’ve heard stories from people complaining about long hours/shit pay, and saying something like “oh well that’s life” or “it is what it is.” Hustle culture has been encouraged and accepted as the norm. People will brag about working 80 hours in a week as if it is a good thing. I’m not blaming the people who are subjected to this, but rather the glorification of this phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social safety nets in America is laughable. One of the wealthiest countries on earth can’t provide a large portion of it’s citizenry with healthcare? A large chunk of the population can’t afford higher education, and the wealth inequality is getting worse with each passing day. I don’t see an excuse for these egregious shortcomings. So in my opinion, America is a terribly run country where only Americans think it’s great because they’ve been conditioned to accept it and love it. CMV&lt;/p&gt;

But I&amp;#39;d argue that we don&amp;#39;t actually elect people who represent our views to vote on our behalf, instead we do strategic voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many fewer people vote 3rd party than they would like because they feel like it&amp;#39;s throwing away their vote. If they had the ability to have their first choice be their third party candidate, and their second choice to be the lesser of two evils among the mainstream parties, then their vote would still count and they could accomplish their goal of giving 3rd party candidates more legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic shows how sweden&amp;#39;s parliament would be with/without FPTP voting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/nynmyz8b14v51.jpg&quot;&gt;https://i.redd.it/nynmyz8b14v51.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: basically, i&amp;#39;m looking for someone to try to convince me that ranked choice is not the best form of voting in a representative democracy. That could either be first-to-the-post (what we have now) or something else&lt;/p&gt;
