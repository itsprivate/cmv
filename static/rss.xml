&lt;p&gt;These firearms do not appear out of thin air. Many of them are stolen from homes or vehicles via home invasions, vehicle thefts, robberies, etc. Some of them are obtained by people purchasing them via less traceable but still legal means and reselling them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If overall obtainability was significantly reduced, over time, fewer guns would be in the hands of criminals, as fewer “good guys with guns” would be needed to “stop bad guys with guns” (note: I do not subscribe to this theory, but for conversation sake I am using it).&lt;/p&gt;

If you are not from the United States, let me quickly explain: many Americans believe that the men who led the push to gain independence from Great Britain, in the 1770s and then draft the U.S. Constitution in the 1780s had a flawless understanding of law and order and created a basically perfect form of government. Every political decision must be considered in flight of, “what the Founders intended”. Here’s an example that sums up this style of thinking perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History shows us, though, that the Founders did consider several times during the 1787 Constitutional Convention electing the president by a popular vote – and repeatedly, the Framers debated the idea and resoundingly rejected it. They knew, almost unanimously, from studying history that democracies tend to implode in short order. They realized that the population was the least informed segment in the country and the most easily manipulated&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myjournalcourier.com/opinion/article/Commentary-John-Crawford-A-defense-of-the-16042980.php&quot;&gt;read the whole thing here, if you dare!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got that, everyone?  People in 1787 had a better understand of what democracies “tend to do” than people do today. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should give you a good taste of how ridiculous this way of thinking is, but it’s used by all sorts of  people in the U.S. Right now we are in the middle of a huge national debate about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/545124-founders-would-roll-their-eyes-at-warrens-filibuster-claim&quot;&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2021/03/26/no_to_dc_statehood_145484.html&quot;&gt;DC statehood&lt;/a&gt; and, everyone’s perennial favorite, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meaww.com/second-amendment-to-us-constitution-chilling-boulder-shooting-puts-a-question-mark-on-gun-rights&quot;&gt;2nd Amendment&lt;/a&gt;! Click on those links and you will see how people on both sides of the political aisle will argue, “what the Founders intended” about any of these subjects. It is an utterly fatuous way of thinking. Let me give a few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Founders were not just one thing –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, an interesting thing about the guys who wrote the Constitution is that they didn’t all just immediately die in 1787. They went on to become the first politicians of the U.S. and they did not really get on all that well.  In fact, Thomas Jefferson, himself was a Founder (he wrote the Declaration of Independence) but not a Framer (he actually opposed the Constitution for some time). So, if they weren’t of one mind about the issues of their day why would anyone assume, they would agree on the issues of our day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Founders did not intend many things that we take for granted –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun game. What do the following things have in common: political parties, primary elections, House and Senate committee assignments, Senate majority leaders, filibusters, judicial review, the number of supreme court justices, members of the President’s cabinet, Executive orders, income tax, voting rights, and term limits? They all do not appear in the original 1787 Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights. They were not intended. How well do you think the United States would function if we tried to get rid of any these things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Founders had no idea what our life would be like today –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it goes without saying that the Constitution is seriously old. In 1787 the Industrial Revolution had not even really started yet. The Founders were writing from a world that did not have anything faster than a horse or a sailing ship.  Nearly everything they consumed was produced locally by craftsman. They had no idea what was ahead of them. As such, they intended all kinds of pretty things that never happened. George Washington wanted to avoid “foreign entanglements” and political “factions”. Thomas Jefferson dreamed that the U.S. would be an agrarian nation of “yeoman farmers” (whatever that means). It was not to be because it turned out to be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s not disrespectful or unwise to disregard “what the Founders intended”. It’s just progress that comes with any institution. Did the pioneers of electric power generation intend that someday their invention would be used to download porn? No, because they would have no idea what that means. It is similarly pointless to wonder what the Founders would say about the immigration policy, police brutality, the Federal Reserve, etc. They had no context for understanding those issues as we do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Founders intended that we would make changes –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t want to get all meta on you but the Founders did not intend for us to worry too much about what they intended. They were pretty smart and educated dudes and they understood they were up to something new. It was clear to them that coming generations would need to make changes. That’s why they added the elastic clause of the Constitution which reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Congress shall have Power... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is old-timey English for, “figure this out for yourselves, guys. If you need to add stuff, go ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. There are some pretty big issues in front of Americans at the moment and there are plenty of solid meaningful arguments to be made for and against DC statehood, abolishing the filibuster, enacting gun control, establishing a national popular vote and many more, but “what the Founders intended” is not one of them. This is just a way to manipulate people by appealing to ideas of long dead men who cannot offer any clarity or depth to the argument and whose true opinions are unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or am I missing something? Is there sense to considering what the Founders intended is deciding the political issues of our day?&lt;/p&gt;

Several Pokedex entries tell of its destructive capability and how powerful it is. Such an awesome and frightening being should be considered dragon-like, no? Here are my arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like a dragon. I know this is a weak point because Applin exists, but come on. Gyarados is modeled after an eastern dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type advantages. This poor thing is allergic to electric attacks. Granted, it has a serviceable Sp. Def. stat, but ×4 weakness to electric attacks makes what&amp;#39;s supposed to be this powerful giant into kind of a laughing stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payoff. Magikarp levels up slowly. If you have no Exp. Share, it&amp;#39;s grueling. Dragon types (at least in the earlier generations) are scarce and powerful. This would make training a Magikarp so worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gyarados is Gen 1. There is only one evolutionary line of dragon types, which would be the Dragonite line. Gen 1 was severely lacking in dragon variety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a hill I&amp;#39;ll die on, but I have no idea why GameFreak made Gyarados water/flying. It should&amp;#39;ve been water/dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens in the randomest of places:  out for a walk in the park, overseas on the beach, sometimes the person can get downright lecturing or nasty for no apparent reason.  They seem to take people as some kind of unrepentant sinner that needs saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By the way I belong to this church and it&amp;#39;s really great&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Have you read the Bible&amp;quot;.  It can sometimes be difficult to bite one&amp;#39;s tongue and stick to a polite &amp;quot;no thanks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part of it is the dishonesty, of being approached or spoken to for five or ten minutes, and then the ambush.  It&amp;#39;s rude, it&amp;#39;s not honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change my view?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  maybe a little illustration would help.  Imagine bumping into a real life example of Kai Win during your day, and they start in on you about the Prophets and are you a good Bajoran.  And they act like Kai Win, with all the persistence and self righteousness.  Only you&amp;#39;re not Bajoran but they won&amp;#39;t listen.

But when you take someone’s life due to you doing something wrong/criminal like, even if you didn’t intend to really harm that person and they lose their life, you should be punished by the courts system. The guy that loss his life has a family at home. What does his wife and children do? They can’t get their husband/father back. In this case I don’t want to see a pat on the wrist. People need to learn early , if you go out hear and do something as reckless as that , you will have to face the consequences. How severe those consequences are. I’m don’t work in that field so I really don’t know. I imagine it should be some years though. But for sure something that will teach those individuals a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally know people who support Trump, and their obsession with him is far from healthy (I know that my anecdotal experiences are not a complete proof to my statement, but that’s just as far as I can go with giving a concrete example which I can personally relate to). They have pictures of him hung on their wall, they have mugs with his name, hats, t shirts, driving with a Trump flag just because, boating with a Trump flag, everything is about Trump. I often see videos of people crying because he lost the election, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can of course support your political candidate, no questions there, but that looks more fan-like behavior at this point. It doesn’t seem that they are supporting or even representing the republican party, they seem to just be blindly obsessed with him as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is more concerning is the complete absence of thought process. They sponge-like just inject everything he says and retranslate everything. Sometimes, what they say doesn’t even make sense. For instance, I once heard two Republicans talk about transgenderism in our society and that is what I heard &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, man. It’s all just communist-China propaganda aimed to destroy our society.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just absolutely complete nonsense, it sounds like someone took Trump’s speech, mixed it all up and came out with this. What does China has to do with transgenders in the US? China is probably one of the furthest countries from tolerating transgenders, and what does communism has to do with it? It is just one example, but I see it on every-day basis online, which is scary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I brought up this example, is for the purpose of showing that his supporters will listen to whatever he says, without ever doubting him. And whoever disagrees with him, in their eyes he is a liar and a “communist propagandist”. Just take a look at this election, they refuse to believe anyone who says that Joe Biden won. Quite literally every single institution in the US confirmed Joe Biden’s victory, and they still refuse to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a funny anecdote I heard on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/jokes&quot;&gt;r/jokes&lt;/a&gt; and it is so relevant and true that it hurts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Trump supporters died and went to heaven, there they meet god himself. The god says “Do you have any questions for me, my sons? Ask away!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First trump supporter asks: “Who really won 2020 election?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God responds: “Joe Biden won that election, all fair and square”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Trump supporter turns to the second one and whispers: “Wow, man. Those liberals went further than we thought”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we have it: Donald Trump became a cult like persona, whose supporters believe in anything he says, refusing to believe any other institution. If that’s not a cult for you, then I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

I think if I had grown up in today’s social climate, I might have misidentified myself as trans or nb just because I liked to dress a certain way. I think it’s really harmful towards gender equality to push this idea that if you like activities and ways of presenting that are outside of the stereotypical norm of your sex that you are then trans or nb. 
Taking on medical intervention due to these presentation preferences is such a huge and dangerous move with long term repercussions if the young person ends up growing out of these preferences. Socially transitioning is a pretty big deal too, and I don’t understand why we need to apply a demographic label to a presentation preference. I also think it’s unhealthy for young people to place so much emphasis on labelling themselves, again in accordance to what men and women ‘should’ look like. Life happens in between categorisation. Cut your hair however you want. Wear pants. Wear a skirt. It’s all performance and aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view obviously has nothing to do with those who experience body dysphoria and seek medical and social transitioning to help alleviate that.&lt;/p&gt;

But in this case, that&amp;#39;s exactly what I think it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Folks&amp;quot; is an inclusive word. It means &amp;quot;people.&amp;quot; It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we&amp;#39;re lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as &amp;quot;folks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But apparently, people are intent on spelling it &amp;quot;folx,&amp;quot; with the &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn&amp;#39;t make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. &amp;quot;Folks&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, then they were already included and accepted in that term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term &amp;quot;latinx&amp;quot; (which could be its own discussion, but I&amp;#39;m just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone&amp;#39;s feelings on &amp;quot;latinos/latinas,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;latinx&amp;quot; is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;folx&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; as a reference to the fact that &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn&amp;#39;t have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user&amp;#39;s own ego -- to say, &amp;quot;Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me.&amp;quot; Signaling that you&amp;#39;re a good person in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn&amp;#39;t a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind &amp;quot;folx&amp;quot; is the historical usage of &amp;quot;volk&amp;quot; in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to &amp;quot;the people&amp;quot; as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that&amp;#39;s a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it&amp;#39;s a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn&amp;#39;t forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who spell it as &amp;quot;folx&amp;quot; are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue. CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best compromise when it comes to changing rooms and bathrooms when it comes to gender identity is having at least one gender neutral bathroom or changing area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no downside to it that I can see. Anyone can use it it so it’s not like it won’t be providing a service, Everyone can be comfortable using the bathroom/changing, and i just think it makes everything flow much smoother. &lt;/p&gt;

And the US DOES have their problems, mainly police brutality and health expenses. But still, my point is that, while they do have those problems, they still live in &amp;quot;easy mode&amp;quot; compared to other countries and refuse to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common to hear, mainly young people, say that their country is a &amp;quot;Third world with a gucchi belt&amp;quot; when racial violence happens, well, let me tell you something, when that happens, hundreds of people and organizations arise to fight it and call that event as something shameful that shouldn&amp;#39;t happen, you&amp;#39;ll have people defending the victim. In any REAL 3rd world country, it&amp;#39;s just a normal ass murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also common to hear people about their lack of mental health help, saying that it&amp;#39;s hard to find correct help and that people doesn&amp;#39;t take it seriously. Well, you still can find mental help fairly easy, to my understanding there are free options with charity organizations, but in 3rd world countries, guess what, not only it&amp;#39;s extremely hard to find a therapist, it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;richs only&amp;quot; luxury and the free health stablishments there are not therapists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say that the US is repressive when someone complains or refutes their viewpoint during an open debate or due to the existence of places online with conservative and/or retrogade views, well, at least you aren&amp;#39;t killed for defending the environment (look up &amp;quot;monarch butterfly mexico&amp;quot;) or followed and then kidnapped by the police for being a student in political groups (again, mexico, and a bit of chile...and I think argentina too), that&amp;#39;s worse than someone saying your view is wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other things that show that the US have it objectively easier, but these are the main ones I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

Well the first thing a lot of people like to go to for a good dig on them is &amp;quot;guy must have a small penis haha!&amp;quot; Because that&amp;#39;s easy right? Because if you have a small penis you are less of a human, especially less of a male! People with big penises don&amp;#39;t do that! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is us. The regular ass dudes with not so great penises. I may not speak for the rest of us but not having a large penis is something we are made very aware of as the media, porn, and even women make very clear what a big penis is. So from puberty we become self conscious of this. Often ashamed to reveal our penises to our sexual partners. Then we hear these insults. We see how it is used to demasculate and insult. Then we look down and just, well we just feel worse. We feel we aren&amp;#39;t up to snuff so to say and become even more self conscious. So many we could find a different way to insult asshole dudes besides their theoretical penis size?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: to the people making small penis jokes and generally being rude, way to go, you must be very cool. Good to know the mods are active.&lt;/p&gt;

It is fine to report on these events, but IMO it is &lt;del&gt;incredibly irresponsible&lt;/del&gt; (EDIT: negligent) of journalists to leave out the very important detail - namely the lack of a causal link between these adverse events and the vaccine(s) - out of the headline. Too often this piece of information is relegated to the sub-headline, or even worse, buried paragraphs deep into the article. Here&amp;#39;s an example from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3126785/hong-kong-logs-10-new-covid-19-cases-10-households-ordered&quot;&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt; (arguably the most reputable English broadsheet in Hong Kong, where I&amp;#39;m from), but I&amp;#39;ve seen examples from other places too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that these headlines are contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Maybe the authors believe that most readers are able to distinguish between correlation and causation, but that is surely a dangerous assumption. In Hong Kong, for example, we&amp;#39;re already seeing people not showing up to their vaccine appointments because of these fears; in my opinion the media are partly responsible for this.

If someone is generally quiet with not too much to say, they are commonly labelled as &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;arrogant&amp;quot; since they don&amp;#39;t have much to contribute, rather than being labelled as a good listener for example. People prefer to see this in a negative light but don&amp;#39;t tend to look at the bigger picture - shyer people are still cool to be around and not at all bad people. If you yourself don&amp;#39;t want to make the effort to initiate a conversation with them then you don&amp;#39;t have the right to complain about their quiet nature, especially if they don&amp;#39;t know many people at the event. Sometimes it just takes one question to start a lasting conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, extroverts as just as fun and lively to be around and not at all &amp;quot;annoying&amp;quot;. Preferring to be alone does not make you quirky or unique and often in extreme cases, people try to glamourise social awkwardness which is the worst because it is difficult to live with. Introverts and extroverts complement each other quite well actually but the personality differences make us criticise one another without trying to understand we are all in fact different and nobody is going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I believe many of us are ambiverts as we tend to be more comfortable and chatty around people we know for a while. So, it is unfair to judge a person who is in a social setting around newer people - you can&amp;#39;t just form an opinion of them if they simply don&amp;#39;t know anyone. There is a lot more to a person than how much they prefer socialising or having alone time.&lt;/p&gt;

As I grew older, I realized the I didn’t have a reason to be Christian. I just didn’t have a reason to believe. But when I was little, I believed it without a thought. I was taught that it was true, so I believed it was true. I just don’t believe that something like this is fair. It doesn’t let someone formulate their own opinion on a huge factor in their life, and having it constantly being shoved down their throats makes it more likely they’ll grow to hate it.

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t believe hard work ALONE is enough for a financially successful life for some people. If hard work was all it took, wouldn&amp;#39;t many people living in poverty in third world countries be far more better off economically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t some people just accept that there are various unfair factors that make others unsuccessful and others not successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying one cannot change their, but many factors can make it far more difficult for others to reach a more financial stable life compared to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really also dislike when someone from an unfortunate background has some how changed their circumstances, but then when are successful, tell everyone they had no help so stop making excuses, and that they don&amp;#39;t feel sorry for anyone else. They suddenly believe it was ONLY their hard work that put them where they are, and not an ounce of luck was involved or some other factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add: I believe that hard work is mandatory. of course. I also know that it puts you in a better position than not working.  All I&amp;#39;m saying is that there&amp;#39;s an ignorance that those in unfortunate positions are lazy, and some people(only some) who are extremely successful are the result of EXTREME HARD WORK, which is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I know many successful people did and do work hard to get to where they are.  It is just in my own unpopular opinion that not everyone&amp;#39;s hard work ALONE will get them to a certain level of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I do think as people who should be aware of what control we have so that we can  put ourselves in positions of opportunity that is reachable for each of us at a present time.&lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;#39;t afford any luxuries - I only eat at the cafeteria, cycle through the same few outfits, etc. The only reason I can even pay tuition is because I was fortunate enough to be granted a scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love reading, and I&amp;#39;ve loved it for as long as I can remember. Growing up in a poor family, we got most of our books through exchanges and used book sales. I vividly remember reading dog-eared fantasy novels as a kid, usually ones that were part of a series I&amp;#39;d never be able to finish. However, I had all but stopped reading since I joined college, because it was just too expensive a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a year ago, a friend of mine introduced me to the world of online shadow libraries - sites where you can freely download copies of any book you wish. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve been reading ebooks on my phone for hours every day. I stay really far from home and don&amp;#39;t have a lot of close friends, so immersing myself in them helps me alleviate some of the stress. I know that I should support the authors of the books I read in some way, so I always write glowing reviews of books I enjoy and recommend them wherever I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend yesterday, and the topic of book piracy came up. I admitted that I had pirated quite a few books myself, and she was taken aback - she said that using such sites to read books was basically stealing from the author. I told her that I don&amp;#39;t really have any other option, and she said that that doesn&amp;#39;t justify it. Another close friend of mine told me the same thing when I asked for his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation got me thinking about a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have the choice between reading books and enriching my life or not reading at all. Both options cost the author nothing. Is the moral choice in my situation not to read?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing the same book from a friend, as opposed to downloading it, would also cost me nothing and generate the author no income. So is that any better or worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware the prevailing viewpoint is that book piracy is bad, and participating in it is also bad - so I&amp;#39;m ready to change my view. Excited to read your takes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I don&amp;#39;t have a local library at all where I live, much less one that provides free ebooks. So that&amp;#39;s out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Due to my lack of knowledge in the topic, I wrote this post mostly thinking about open relationships, so maybe take that into consideration when reading this. But it also works for other non-monogamous relationships &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that although I don’t get it, I respect any consenting adult’s decision to be in this or any other type of relationship. You do you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can’t help but feel like polyamorous people are afraid of missing out on “the best things” in life for being tied up to someone else. Instead of picturing the million things and experiences they could have with a partner, they seem to immediately consider the opposite, what they think they won’t be able to do. It’s almost as if they already expect the worst in every partner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard the argument that not all partners are equal: that while you may have a main partner, you may also have one for cuddling, another for traveling and whatnot. But most people already have different friends/colleagues for different occasions, so why do polyamorous people feel the need to be romantically/sexually involved with others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree that love isn’t just the feelings of infatuation, attraction, etc. Actual love comes with effort, selflessness and patience, so when someone claims to love another but can’t seem to compromise on some personal desires, they just seem selfish and insatiable. They just seem to be always looking for the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Sam Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Halle Barre to just name a few.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel like nowadays you don&amp;#39;t see many nonwhite actors in leading roles in blockbusters. It&amp;#39;s almost always in movies about race relations or something.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is cause of comic book movies. Almost all blockbusters are from the same franchise that was created more than half a century ago. Furthermore a lot of other movies are remakes from old movies or historical tales.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: I believe that there is a general lack of original storytelling that prevents stories from being told that would represent the current population and diversity. Where is the action thrillers, sceince fiction stories, crime thrillers or comedies etc that many nonwhite actors got big with?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I&amp;#39;m saying is that if Hollywood wasn&amp;#39;t so obsessed with remakes and adapting known stories then there would be less of a diversity problem.&lt;br/&gt;

I’ve been unbelievably irritated by diet and nutrition advice over the years, and have always felt it could be potentially dangerous — so I just wanted to get that out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard eating healthier can improve overall energy, but I don’t understand how it’s measured or how science can determine this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I generally believe eating healthy is good and can possibly help prevent issues like obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart issues, and very specific diagnoses focused on food (like celiac disease) but I have heard it can influence specific illnesses that have nothing to do with diet too and I disagree with that aspect. And it’s been hard to find solid evidence about the correct diet for everyone, I’ve found too much variation among advice and between individuals to get a solid idea of how the field can apply their advice or science to the population as a whole. So, I guess I’m just convinced almost none of it is helpful unless a person suffers from a very specific food related issue, or consumes mostly processed/junk food long term. And personally, I have never noticed feeling worse or any ill effects when eating super unhealthy, and I haven’t noticed anything when I’ve tried to eat healthier either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’ve looked into it, I’ve found the field is rapidly changing and contradicting which foods cause inflammation or prevent it, and even experts seem to disagree about what specific ingredients and vitamins are doing. I know some food items used in medication at higher amounts or altered have had great healing properties and that many pills can be derived from natural resources, but I don’t see how nutrition does much else on its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m misunderstanding the field of nutrition and what it’s used for, so honestly any insight would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I realized my view is more against alternative medicine and the constant flood of inaccurate health advice than real nutrition — it had blurred some of the lines for me knowing where one began and the other ended. Also edited to differentiate between type 2 diabetes in my post.&lt;/p&gt;

We do this for many reason - to maintain freshness, the. ‘aesthetics’ of choosing a lobster out of a tank to eat, the difficulty of actually killing lobsters through others means, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I really don’t think we should be boiling them alive anymore. We have technology now that can electrocute lobsters to kill them much more quickly. When we boil them alive, it takes them around 30 seconds to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do lobsters feel pain when they’re being boiled? I mean, I think they do. They thrash and try to climb out of pots. Lobsters in the wild are very sensitive to ocean temperatures due to migratory patterns. So it makes sense that they’d feel pain, or at least &lt;em&gt;great discomfort&lt;/em&gt; when they’re being boiled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boiling of lobsters alive is a cruelty no longer outweighed by utility. It’s unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the people who boil lobsters alive are like, monsters or anything. It’s a tradition, and it’s hard to empathize or understand the experience of a lobster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change my view, you don’t have to convince me that it’s somehow a good thing to boil lobsters alive, just that the utility of boiling them alive justifies the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Reading the reddit comments made me realize that no one in positions of power really care about the people at the bottom of the pit. The honest truth is greed will come before anything else and at any cost even to the bottom line. You can throw all the numbers and economics you want, but everything will remain status quo. The only way I see any sort of drastic change to help the people who are most in need is if a civil war happened. Sounds stupid and naive and edgy, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t see any other way to get the people at the top to change their minds. You can&amp;#39;t pull money out of politics because corporations and billionaires have the money and power to overthrow the government and hold them like puppets. So the only way to fix this is to dismantle and rebuild the structure of governance from the ground up to earn back the trust of the people and hold the corporations and the rich accountable for their actions. If they don&amp;#39;t make radical changes to fix the systemic issues of the government helping the poor get out of poverty to match modern times, nothing will get done and poor people will remain poor and the rich will continue to become richer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L (Lesbian): women attracted to women&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G (Gay): men attracted to men&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B (Bisexual): people of either gender attracted to either gender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T (Trans): people of either gender who feel they are of the other gender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ones I can see fitting in would be intersex and asexual. Everything else, like queer, pansexual, demisexual, etc, is just one of the four letters but with extra steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some are just offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of pansexual. People typically describe this as when you don’t really notice gender, you only care about personality and chemistry and a connection. So... you’re basically saying bi people are all a bunch of sluts? Because by this definition, a bisexual person who was looking for a meaningful connection regardless of gender would be pansexual. But they aren’t. They’re just bi people looking for a connection. Hence, pansexual is just bisexual with extra steps. Queer... wtf is queer anyhow? I’ve had some people explain it to me as like overly flamboyant gay men who sorta express their sexuality in how they dress but I don’t know if that definition is apt. I’ve had others express it as straight men who are effeminate and maybe drag queens who are still straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even asexuals... like, which asexuals need to be incorporated into a group based on protecting people’s sexual identities? Has there ever been a time when society oppressed people who weren’t getting laid, by choice or not? Ever? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT seems to cover all the bases. The extra letters (again, except intersex and maybe asexual) seem to moreso cover the extent to which people are expressive and their fetishes and such. The fact that many of us have to go and google what the words mean I think shows they’re meaningless. I’m not sure why a group would need protecting if society doesn’t know wtf they are to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree that there is WAY too much of it. While I agree that cultural elements probably play a part but I also think some of the biological elements that lead men to extreme behaviors in pretty much every avenue, are also responsible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become a very common and accepted thing lately to assert that all men are responsible and that we essentially have to clean up our act. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily disagree with this. However, we are essentially saying that the group at large is responsible for the crimes of an extreme subgroup. The exact same arguments that are leveled against men can be applied in a lot of very un-PC contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are Muslims responsible for Islamic extremists ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are black Americans responsible for the excessive murder rates in parts of the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are Greenlanders responsible for the excessive child abuse that occurs in parts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you listen to the likes of Tommy Robinson (who is generally considered a bigot in media), his arguments are very similar to those being leveled against men now. i.e. Not all Muslims - but Islamic culture breeds extremism and he asks why more Muslims are not doing more and calling out those in their community with more extremist ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not clear to me why his ideas are &amp;#39;obviously bigoted rubbish&amp;#39; while in the case of men&amp;#39;s violence against women, it is asserted as obviously correct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear to me however that the average guy feels much like the average Muslim does in scenarios where there is some terrorist incident, i.e. &amp;#39;whoa thats fucked up, but has nothing to do with me or reflects my attitude&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, just to make sure. I have not stated my opinion on any of the issues (Men&amp;#39;s violence, Islam, murders in black America, child abuse in Greenland), this CMV is about the my belief that the arguments leveled against men could just as easily be leveled against these other groups, and that our response to these arguments should probably be the same, whatever that response might be.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m talking about a semi normal relationship/marriage where a partnery cheats. I understand that you may feel lonely and that your partner is putting enough effort into the relationship, and even  after the cheating has been done I&amp;#39;m not even saying that the relationship can&amp;#39;t be salvaged. It&amp;#39;s just that I&amp;#39;ve seen several movies now in the past few months where a woman has cheating on her husband and the husband has had to reflect on the relationship, and realized that some of the blame was on him. The problem is with these movies is that the man usually takes all the blame and none is given to the partner. I get that you may feel lonely, but you should reach out to your partner or if all else fails have a seperation, but just going out and cheating is never right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Again, I just want to say, it is at fault of both people in the relationship. The person who alienated their partner enough to where they felt that cheating was the only option definitely has fault in the relationship, but basically what I am saying is that the majority fault comes to the person who cheated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also get that a lot of people don&amp;#39;t even understand why I posted this in the first place, since this seems very clear that cheating is wrong on pointless to have a discussion about it, but I will just paste what I replied to another commenter to hopefully get you guys to understand my thought proccess &amp;quot; I posted it because I felt that there may be people who don&amp;#39;t agree with what I have to say, and if what I&amp;#39;m saying can be argued against or even proven wrong, I would like to know that I am wrong, rather than continue the rest of my life believing a sentiment that is untrue. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

If you don&amp;#39;t feel like clicking the article I linked to, here&amp;#39;s the bit that I really want to focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harvard and Yale—two of the world’s most prestigious institutions—actively&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/06/23/a-lawsuit-reveals-how-peculiar-harvards-definition-of-merit-is&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;discriminate against Asians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Once controlling for variables, Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford showed Asians face odds&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691141606/manhattaninstitu/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://asianamericanforeducation.org/en/issue/discrimination-on-admissions/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;higher than other groups to be accepted to elite colleges.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t say that this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard of this because it&amp;#39;s not, and I won&amp;#39;t say that I am categorically opposed to considering other factors that &amp;quot;merit&amp;quot; in college admissions because I am not.   But what really got me thinking how they hell is whether or not someone is &amp;quot;Asian&amp;quot; any kind of factor, at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/237584/distribution-of-the-world-population-by-continent/#:%7E:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20about%2059.51,total%20population%20by%20continent%20here&quot;&gt;60% of the entire population&lt;/a&gt; of the world lives in Asia.  Are we supposed to believe that  someone from Bangladesh, a country with a per capita income of less than $5000 per annum should be measure by the same standards as someone of Japanese decent, a country that has one of the highest standards of living in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is an Asian?  I&amp;#39;ll bet if you looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmyks#/media/File:Kirsan_Ilyumzhinov_2014.jpg&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;d say, &amp;quot;Yep, that is an Asian person!&amp;quot;  You would be wrong he is European.  And indigenous to European Russia at that. OK, what about &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ksenia_Sukhinova#/media/File:MissWorld_2008_(cropped&quot;&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt;.jpg)?  She&amp;#39;s a native of Asia, born at the same longitude as New Delhi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, would someone please tell me how Asian can be used as a standard for anything?  You can find people of every race, religion, socio-economic group, political affiliation, and skin tone living in Asia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that on average people of Asian extraction (60% of the world) do quite well in America.  Do you think that matters to people from Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Bangladesh, who are immigrating to escape abject poverty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just goes to show how utterly arbitrary race is and why parental income is a much better factor to take into account in admitting people to prestigious educational institutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost never does anyone advocating for this think it through all the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it&amp;#39;s nonsensical given the statistics.  Mass shooters are not more likely to have a diagnosed mental illness than anyone else.  People with mental illness are dramatically more likely to be the victim of violent crimes than the perpetrator.  Misogyny, racism, and/or being an extremist ideologue are NOT mental illnesses.  Implying that all mass murderers automatically must have mental illness is not only objectively wrong, but it also exacerbates horrible bigoted stereotypes about thing like schizophrenia and personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger issue I see is the unintended side effects of this type of legislation seem inevitable.Most mass shooters are men.  Men own guns at a dramatically higher rate than women.  Women are way more likely to have a diagnosed mental disorder.  Why?  Because they seek treatment more than men.We already have a HUGE issue with men avoiding therapy or medical help with mental issues.  The type of men who are armed to the teeth and ready to shoot up a public place are the exact same types that see therapy as something for &amp;quot;Weak minded people&amp;quot; and/or don&amp;#39;t trust medical authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it all mental health screenings for gun ownership would do is dramatically increase the number of men who absolutely refuse to seek any treatment. If a diagnoses means no guns, toxic men will choose keeping their gun rights over treatment 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, banning guns from people who have diagnosed mental illness will make the mental illness crisis worse and the issue of men avoiding treatment dramatically worse without actually working towards it&amp;#39;s intended purpose of making the world a less violent place or getting guns out of the hands of mass shooters.&lt;/p&gt;

While this is a nice idea, it makes absolutely no sense. LGBTQ+ is a community of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, pansexuals, omnisexuals, asexuals, aromantic people, transgender people, nonbinary people, agender people, genderfluid people, intersex people, demiboys, demigirls, allies, etc. Our community has nothing to do with race, and there&amp;#39;s no reason for it to. We are a community of LGBTQ+ people and allies accepting and celebrating who we are. Why should we bring race into it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is, LGBTQ+ is about gender and sexuality, not race. Bringing race into it is highly unnecessary. In fact, by doing so, you&amp;#39;re just lumping all minorities into one big group. What&amp;#39;s so inclusive and happy about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By law, a prosecutor can see to it that nothing you tell the police is used in court to help you. That’s a law. Save the good stuff for your lawyer and your day in court!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, everything you tell the police can be used in court to hurt your case:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You may inadvertently tell them something inaccurate; potentially, that’s perjury.&lt;br/&gt;
• You could waste a perfectly good alibi by getting a detail wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
•  You may tell them something absolutely correct that some expert falsely  disputes and then you’ve lied, again, and you’ve provided them with an  “aha” moment for the jury.&lt;br/&gt;
• You may tell them something that to you seems irrelevant, but to them helps bolster or build a case against you  out of nothing.&lt;br/&gt;
• You may even bend under their pressure and confess to something you did not do!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  cops are allowed to lie to extract a confession: they can lie about  whether you’re a suspect or not, they can lie about what you’re  suspected of, they can lie about details of the case, they are in all  probability lying about any lenience they may be offering you, they are  trained to legally set you up to look like you possess information that  you only could have gotten if you were at the scene of the crime. They  are very unlikely to transcribe or record your conversation accurately  and, again, any errors will play against you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police can legally feed back everything you discussed with them to whoever is accusing you and help them build their case!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None  of this is because the police are bad; it’s because they are people. As  people they are both fallible and liable to look for every possible  angle that can support an initial wrong guess. Some may even be more  than fallible and venal and not want to admit they were wrong to suspect  you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping quiet can help you stay away from all this trouble.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, even this advice is no longer perfect, because the Supreme Court has  ruled that an innocent person would have no reason to say something as  straightforward as “I would not like to speak with you because the  constitution affords me the right to avoid self-incrimination.” These days, you have to invoke a different constitutional right and firmly ask for a lawyer!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the justice system is a system that closes cases, not a system that seeks justice. The antechamber of this Kafkaesque hell is the police station. If you have not managed to avoid the visit to the antechamber, keep quiet until you’ve hired the best legal help you can. In doing so, you’re hiring part of the system, you’re paying cash into the system, you’re getting the system on your side. And you’re involving part of the system that’s a pay grade (or ten) above the cop who’s looking to feed you with your confession and write it up for you. That’s your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if the majority of Reddit is white doesn’t mean that comments will turn into white supremacy rants. If someone is being racist than I would imagine they would get reported or downvoted into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don’t understand why they separate Twitter of all things based on race. It just seems like a strange thing to focus on. &lt;a href=&quot;/r/whitepeopletwitter&quot;&gt;r/whitepeopletwitter&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t verify you or anything, you can say what you want there. Both are about the same content like promoting left wing policies with some racial topics which is fine, it’s what Twitter does so it makes sense that that is the content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weirdest thing to me though is if you ever go to verify, you have to pick if you are &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Black
B. A non white person of color
C. A White ally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all end up with the same result of being given access to post and comment, why is there a need for distinction in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all just seems unnecessarily discriminatory and I don’t think it’s the right mindset for things as common as Twitter posts that could be about anything. I have no problem with subreddits that are meant to talk about issues a race or gender have to deal with unique challenges and issues having some sort of system like they have, I’m just not sure that Twitter account subreddits are the place for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/mbzggv/why_has_r_gone_private&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/mbzggv/why_has_r_gone_private&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tl;dr is that reddit&amp;#39;s newest admin, a woman named Aimee Challenor, lived in the same house as her father while he raped and tortured a child over 10 days for which he was convicted, she was kicked out of some political parties for defending him and is currently married to a man who is openly pedophilic on the internet. Discussions about and criticism of Aimee and her being hired as an admin have been censored, edited by the admin team and users have been banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aimee Challenor is disgusting person who should not have any authority at all over a website that is frequented by millions of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit admins have demonstrated in the past that they are fine with pedophilia by leaving &lt;a href=&quot;/r/jailbait&quot;&gt;r/jailbait&lt;/a&gt; up for YEARS under the guise of free speech and only removing it after being pressured by the media. Hiring Aimee proves that nothing has changed in that respect. Reddit admins have abused their power in the past by censoring criticism and removing or even manually editing critical comments on T_D. &lt;a href=&quot;/u/spez&quot;&gt;u/spez&lt;/a&gt; promised that this abuse of power would never happen again. That was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the facts. Here is the view I want to have changed: I should stop using reddit because continuing to do so means financially supporting some truly horrible people who protect child abusers and an admin team that openly attacks freedom of speech on their platform. The best thing I can do to combat the disgusting behavior of reddit admins is to take my internet traffic somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

Although these mass shooting deaths are very sad, they kind of remind me of airplane crashes - highly sensationalized on media, but play such a miniscule role in the total gun deaths in the US. They only account for 0.2% of all gun deaths&lt;a href=&quot;https://health.ucdavis.edu/what-you-can-do/facts.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to just use mass shootings as the lens to pass gun legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not accounting for suicide, which I&amp;#39;ll touch on later, most gun deaths occur as single or double homicides, which are done overwhelming by pistols or revolvers (~80%). Actually most gun related crimes, including robbery and assault, are also done by handguns (~80%)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6ir6okcjvAhVaOs0KHZs3A-QQFjAAegQIAxAC&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0O0h90mGzdjog3gx2isyCc&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. The first thing this tells us is that blanket banning rifles and shotguns won&amp;#39;t solve our gun problems. I think we need to look why people buy guns in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/3 buy guns for self defense, and 2/5 buy guns for hunting, not mutually exclusive&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/22/facts-about-guns-in-united-states/%3famp=1&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. I think there&amp;#39;s precedent for banning assault style weapons based on this, because those weapons really won&amp;#39;t help either of those scenarios. Let&amp;#39;s be honest, people are buying assault style weapons because they are cool, fun, or to commit crimes with. But banning all guns will hardly have an effect here due to the point in the next paragraph. It&amp;#39;s important to mention that most rifles and shotguns aren&amp;#39;t assault/military style weapons&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. However, this doesn&amp;#39;t include guns for hunting, like bolt action rifles. They don&amp;#39;t account for any appreciable crime as compared to other guns and are in significant use for either sustenance or hobby unlike military style weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this information, coupled with the fact that most guns used in crimes are sourced illegally, points to the fact that banning guns will just render the majority of the population who buys guns for defense defenseless against crime crime&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, banning guns overall will lead to less illegal guns, but are we willing for a huge spike in crime/death due to people being defenseless even if it&amp;#39;s ephemeral in the grand scheme of things? How long will it take for all illegal guns to be purged once all legal guns are banned? The DOJ only seized 30,000 guns a year in the US, and over 300,000 guns are stolen a year, with nearly 1.2 million outstanding stolen guns&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8zOvJmcjvAhWMLc0KHa0DAKEQFjADegQICRAC&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0O0h90mGzdjog3gx2isyCc&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously it&amp;#39;s not 1 to 1, but are we really willing to tolerate 40 years of elevated crime to this end? Buyback programs also won&amp;#39;t help this end, as mainly legal gun owners forfeit their rights. Even if all guns disappear overnight from legal gun owners, which they won&amp;#39;t and is a separate issue altogether, what cost are we willing to pay as society? The crude calculations here certainly paint a picture I&amp;#39;m not willing to tolerate. We need legal guns to fend off illegal guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how do we solve this issue? I think it really relies on how do we ensure that fewer guns go from being legal to illegal. Many guns are stolen from legal owners, and many legal purchases should not have been legal to begin with (mental health issues -&amp;gt; would also help firearm suicide numbers). I&amp;#39;m not really sure, but the answer is general more regulation and background checks, and closing loopholes like gun shows. Guns should still be accessible to a person who passes these criteria, and most people should be able to pass - making guns virtually impossible to eligible is simply a proxy for banning them. Another suggestion so fun accountability - make legal owners have to check in their guns with government entities every so often under threat of hefty fines with non-compliance or failure as to prevent guns from being stolen and to further improve gun security in homes. But banning guns simply isn&amp;#39;t the answer. Change my view.&lt;/p&gt;

This only works if we assume that everyone who commits a crime with a gun is a complete anarchist, with no respect for any law, anywhere. It also assumes that they are all very resourceful and know how to find themselves a black market to purchase a gun, or even how to break in and steal a gun without detection. These are some pretty huge assumptions, yet they are made about literally everyone who commits any kind of shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we not considering the possibility of people snapping? That perhaps humans are not life-long criminals and that a had set of circumstances leads them to think, for perhaps just a short time, &amp;quot;you know what, I&amp;#39;m pissed, I&amp;#39;m going to shoot some people&amp;quot;. Do we really believe that when this pissed-off person encounters barriers that prevent him from buying a gun right away, that he absolutely 100% will keep going, 100% of the time, that there&amp;#39;s a zero percent chance that after failing to obtain a lethal weapon by legal means that he absolutely will, 100% of the time, successfully find a black market or successfully break into a home and steal a weapon, and then not get caught, and then carry out his rampage? Are you starting to see why I think this viewpoint is straight-up ignorant? Because that&amp;#39;s all pretty extreme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even see this effect at play with suicide deaths, and that is almost certainly our biggest opportunity to save lives. Many who survive a suicide attempt get help, get treated, and then lose the desire to kill themselves. The often-cited hypothesis that suicidal people WILL kill themselves no matter what is &lt;em&gt;just not true&lt;/em&gt;, and it pains me to see anyone ever try to peddle that theory, as if mental health problems cannot be treated. They absolutely can be and it is beyond shitty to try and argue that suicidal people are hopeless cases, just to defend a gun stance. That&amp;#39;s actually really disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: some are struggling to understand my view or are embellishing it, so let me be clear: I am simply disagreeing with this viewpoint that 100% of those who committed gun violence would have done it no matter what, that our gun laws will have literally no effect whatsoever. I am not calling for a ban on all guns, confiscation of all guns. I am simply disagreeing with a very common argument that is used often in the gun control debate.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Mirriam-Webster is is  &lt;strong&gt;an exaggerated and often disabling fear usually inexplicable to the subject and having sometimes a logical but usually an illogical or symbolic object, class of objects, or situation.&lt;/strong&gt; That is all it is, that is all it can every be. An irrational FEAR with no LOGIC behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, especially amongst the more liberal conclaves, have been throwing around words like homophobia and transphobia for far to long and far to quickly as a way to delegitimize and silence those with whom we disagree. We rightly should be pilloried for this misuse. Some context may be required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find trans people weird, off-putting and would generally like to avoid their spheres of influence online or otherwise if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will support common sense legislation that expands the rights of trans individuals (The only exception being self identification for sports but that is another matter rooted far more in safety)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To my more liberal friends, I am a bigot and a transphobe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where the problem is. Transphobe here is being used to prop up moral absolutism and not an accurate summation of either myself or my view. I am but one such example. There is a key here, I do not fear trans induvial. I have made a decision, through some analysis of my feelings, and come to the conclusion that I do not find that lifestyling appealing and therefore will avoid it if I can. That is not missing logic nor is that a fearful way of thinking. I will not delve into false equivalencies because I do not wish to stir a hornets nest, but I will provide some grounding arguements to work with so you can attempt to CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Gays are going to infect my child and take over America as we not it.&amp;quot; - Clear homophobia / &amp;quot;My religious belief does not condone homosexuality, therefore nor do I.&amp;quot; - Not homophobia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Trans individuals will undermine and destroy Christian life!&amp;quot; - Transphobia / &amp;quot;I do not believe people should identify outside of their societal norms.&amp;quot; - Closeminded, but not Transphobic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be far more targeted in our use of words ending in phobia. Next time you want to throw that word around, sit back and really ask yourself if it matches the definition. If it makes it easier, don&amp;#39;t think about controversial uses of phobia. Think about acrophobia, something I freely admit I suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not matter what situation, how secure I am, whether I am bolted to 3000 tons of steel by reinforced cable, if I know I am high, I am PETRIFIED and can often not be reasoned with. THAT IS A PHOBIA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer not to be high if I can avoid it but can climb up stairs no problem - NOT PHOBIC. Reasoned resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still can call someone a bigot and prejudiced without calling them phobic. And they can be prejudiced and bigoted without being phobic. Change My View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: After scrolling through the comments, I have found an answer that satisfies my curiosity and has effectively CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;posted by &lt;a href=&quot;/u/rollingForInitiative&quot;&gt;u/rollingForInitiative&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; Homo/bi/transphobia are not &amp;quot;phobias&amp;quot; in the medical sense. They&amp;#39;re better compared to words like racism and sexism.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I accept the notion that there is an evolving definition of phobia that is not rooted in the medical diagnosis, as many of you have pointed out that I missed the secondary definition of -phobia, then this is in effect the appropriate use of the term in reference to social groups. I don&amp;#39;t inherently like it, but it does seem to fit on face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider my view changed and have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Edit: Pardon my being slow and new to the board. I have awarded the appropriate deltas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Edit: I have enjoyed those who engaged in thoughtful discussion, less so those of you who attacked me personally or did not read the comments or edits and simply went to the &amp;quot;You are a bigot&amp;quot; drive by. Equally, though I used the example of religion, I find it amusing people assumed with no justification I was religious and used that as part of the basis for how I feel. Fun fact, practicing athiest. This was my first CMV post and I plan to stay, but we have some serious judgement trolls on this board.&lt;/p&gt;

I believe trans-people have rights, should not be discriminated against and have every right to bodily autonomy to do what they wish with their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping someone smarter/more knowledgeable than me can help de-tangle some of these concepts for me so I&amp;#39;m less ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I however, don&amp;#39;t understand some of the arguments and how they are being legislated.  I&amp;#39;m not understanding the logic.  I&amp;#39;ve done a moderate amount of reading on the topic, both objectively, wikis etc. As well as arguments from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s My current understanding of the Concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex&lt;/strong&gt;: Is someone&amp;#39;s biological characteristic of an organism.  It is assigned at birth.  (Male/Female) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender&lt;/strong&gt;: While historically this has been synonymos with biological sex.  In recent thought, gender is a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender&quot;&gt;socially constructed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; concept that encompasses all of the socially determined traits of what society considers to be masculine or feminine. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Identity&lt;/strong&gt; is a personal sense of one&amp;#39;s own Gender &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.   &amp;quot;Gender identity refers to a personal identification with a particular gender and gender role in society&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transgender&lt;/strong&gt; is a person who has a gender Identity that differs from the sex they were assigned with at birth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken at face value.  I understand the above concepts, and they all make sense to me.  However, when I begin thinking through the implications of the above definitions I run into what I consider to be contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confusion 1: Is Gender a social construct or is it an  individual trait?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the arguments around Transgender Rights seem to focus on the fact that Gender is an individually inherent trait.  (See above definition of gender Identity).      If gender is a construct of society, how can one&amp;#39;s sense of gender be an individual trait?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Corollary How can gender Identity be something a person is born with, when gender is fundamentally a social construct&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents for Transgender rights, and proponents for making it a protected class argue that because gender Identity is an immutable characteristic of an individual given to them from birth, it is a form of human nature, and not behavior.  Thus it deserves to be protected.  Scientific studies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; are cited as showing that there are biological differences of transgender humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However... How does this work?  If the concept of &amp;quot;gender&amp;quot; fundamentally is one constructed by society.  How is it possible we could know that a person&amp;#39;s identity is different than what society says it should be?  I get that humans of various sexes might have different masculine or feminine traits, and I get how that might make them act in different ways, or have certain dispositions to certain behaviors.  But I don&amp;#39;t understand why that necessarily matters, if we say &amp;quot;gender&amp;quot; is a constructed thing anyway.  At what point is there a difference between &amp;quot;A biological male who likes traditionally feminine things&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;A biological male who identifies with a traditional female gender identity&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confusion 2:  Is gender independent of sex or not?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of literature lately that argues that sex and gender are decoupled.  But it seems to me, that the concept of gender from the perspective of a trans-person  is inexorably tied to sex.  ie: I identify with the societal accepted identity of a female defined by sex and expected via gender role.  Therefore, I want to also be viewed as female not just in gender, but biologically as sex as well and undergo HRT or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these concepts are decoupled, why is transitioning your biological sex to match your gender identity considered an effective treatment?  Doesn&amp;#39;t that at least PARTIALLY contradict this idea that sex and gender two different things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confusion 3:  If Gender is even partially a social construct, why is it being given significantly more political capital than other social-pressures-of-social-constructs experienced by humans?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my really poor and hopefully not inadvertently racist example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also widespread in modern times to also classify &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_society&quot;&gt;Race as a social construct&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.  However, the construct of race, while also protected, and also core to a person&amp;#39;s identity.  Doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have similar in-congruence or &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; issues as gender does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am biologically assigned a male and have genetic traits of being a causation, but I identify with the gender identity, gender roles, and societal expectations of female.   I should be protected and treated AS MY CHOSEN gender expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am biologically assigned a Slav and have genetic traits of being Slavic, but I identify with the racial identity, racial characterizations, and racial expectations of  being Chinese.  Why can I not be recognized and protected for my identification of being Chinese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both Race and Gender are a social construct, but simultaneously innate to an individual&amp;#39;s identity, why can one be changed, and the other not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to generalize this out further If Gender is a socially constructed based on the actions and behaviors of different people groups.  Why is the choice to take actions, and identify with other people groups pushed to be protected for nearly any other behavior?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sort of have a hard time understanding such a precedent, because Its hard to draw a line when it stops.   By such legal precedent, what stops people from claiming identity an another societal construct that is in congruent with biological assignment and using it a means to claim discrimination? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confusion 4: If the goal here is to allow Transgender people freedom of expression of their gender, and protection from discrimination.  Why are a lot of the laws re-classifying sex  as gender?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an earlier point, Since we&amp;#39;ve already discussed how gender and sex are explained as decoupled.  Why is legislation such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_(United_States&quot;&gt;Equality Act&lt;/a&gt;) re-defining sex discrimination to include gender identity, when we are very clearly trying to decouple the concepts of sex and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, this makes it now impractical/illegal to divide based on the construct of biological sex as opposed to gender identity.   sports teams, restrooms, prisons etc. can now no longer segregate based on biology, but rather on identity.  But I don&amp;#39;t really understand how a lot of these things are a practical GENDER discrimination, as none of these things are making an individual unable to act freely according to their own identity any more than how football is biological ablest discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example: Urinals by their very design are discriminatory against people without penises. However, I don&amp;#39;t understand fact that a bathroom that exists for people with penises, is somehow a discrimination against someones Gender Identity (which is decoupled from their biological sex)?   I understand the discrimination here based on biological sex.  I don&amp;#39;t understand how this is a discrimination based on gender Identity.  That is, unless your &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot; is predicated going into a specific bathroom... But that&amp;#39;s a social construct anyway.. (see point 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Obviously long. And I&amp;#39;ll award a delta for any of the above points or misunderstandings that I have.
Just a Guy trying to have a better, more nuanced view on the matter.  &lt;/p&gt;

The way I see it they are just like any other investor. for example: if I had a set amount of money, say 100000, and i wanted to invest it. There were 2 options: buy a tesla stock, or buy an apartment to supplement my income. Obviously there are bad landlords that mistreat their tenants, but I still don&amp;#39;t see why people hate them just for that fact. It&amp;#39;s ridiculous to me to be honest, But seeing as there are so many people completely against me, they must have some good opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now obviously if you think all investors are bad, that is a little different than what I was thinking&lt;/p&gt;

Its something that sparks a mild existential crisis pretty much every time I think about it. I tend to vacillate back and forth between the two viewpoints but I feel like believing things DO happen for a reason is just a comforting defense mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think opinions on this matter are all totally subjective, and based almost entirely on each person&amp;#39;s life experience. Not to be condescending but with the exception of religious reasons, I think optimistic folks are only that way because they haven&amp;#39;t endured the level of trauma or loss or suffering people like myself have. I am incredibly jaded, nihilistic, cynical, detached, desensitized, etc. so its impossible for me to look at what goes on in the world and think there&amp;#39;s some grand design or master plan or metaphysical force at work. Even just in my own life terrible things have consistently happened since birth and I&amp;#39;ve always been a good human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;d like to discuss this in as practical a way as possible. Why do you believe things happen for a reason? And be specific. What theories do you have that support things happening for a reason EVEN IF you don&amp;#39;t believe it? What evidence is there that life isn&amp;#39;t random chaos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to get as philosophical/scientific as you want. As long as you explain how/why it supports your belief with specifics. I know this will bring us into territory like free will, physics, determinism, etc. but keep it related to changing my view if you can! I urge you to share your opinion on the stereotypical problems in this discussion like cancer, brain aneurysms, innocent children dying, etc. Sorry to be dark but this is an innately dark topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLARIFICATION EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Some are getting caught up on the semantics of what I mean by &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; so let me be clear. I&amp;#39;m referring to negative events outside our control like natural disasters, innocent people dying in shootings/accidents, cancer, stuff like that. Bad things happening to people randomly, especially really good people. And as for the reason part I don&amp;#39;t mean literally the scientific quantifiable reason. &amp;quot;An electrical imbalance in these storm clouds caused a discharge resulting in lightning striking and killing this person&amp;quot;. No. I mean a reason as in this person deserved it/ it was meant to happen/ it was part of some plan/ it was karma, and so on. I&amp;#39;m refuting the widely used phrase &amp;quot;everything happens for a reason&amp;quot; and everyone knows what that implies so come on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m trying my best to address everyone! I will eventually get to you. Honestly I expected to be downvoted away but I greatly appreciate everybody&amp;#39;s input and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often people make sweeping generalizations against their fellow citizens, reducing them to a binary descriptor: “trumpers” or “communists,” “racists” and “facists,” etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is frankly much more nuance to a given human. But Facebook (an app that blatantly only shows you things that confirms your suspicions), CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Twitter — they all want to tear that nuance away, and too many people aren’t smart enough to know better. I fear my children will grow up in a world where someone makes an assumption about them based on &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; their skin color, &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; their political orientation, and/or &lt;strong&gt;(c)&lt;/strong&gt; anything that doesn’t involve a &lt;em&gt;dialogue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve recently watched three TV documentaries on the subject of online trolling.... Caroline Flack: Her life and death, Jesy Nelson: Odd one out, and Celebrity Trolls: We’re coming to get you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three focussed on the impact online abuse can have on mental health and indeed physical well-being of the subject. One recipient of such online abuse, Caroline Flack, actually took her own life in the end. Although of course this cannot be attributed directly to online trolling, her family seemed convinced it was at least a contributing factor. In all three shows screen grabs of offensive messages were displayed, but with the originating Twitter handle masked. If there was an immediate consequence then I believe it may give trolls cause to think twice before hitting “send.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding all “free speech” debates around whether an individual should be allowed to make derogatory remarks about another online, I believe when such comments are made they should be readily attributed to the handle that posted them. There is I believe no good reason to hide the identity of the person/account that posted the abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try a lot to resolve my problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading about my abandonment issues (attachment theory etc, my parents separated when I was 3 months old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;medical treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical activity (running 60 min every 2 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pursuing projects and a schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going into therapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staying positive and having a positive outlook on life in general (finding pro/cons into everything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be outgoing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compartmentalization and telling intimate ones I don&amp;#39;t need them to be my therapist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faking my own well being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to speak with my relatives and parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding substance at all cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are things that cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individualism and natural selection are fair reasons for people like me to be rejected and left alone. That&amp;#39;s how life works. If most people dislike depressive people, because they are seen as weak, and if a women feels insecure and refuse to be with a depressed individual, it is normal and there is nothing to be angry about. It might be difficult to live with, but it&amp;#39;s important to remember this fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: there is nothing wrong with being rejected because of one own&amp;#39;s medical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tigers, especially Siberian, are more impressive and frightening in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tigers are lone hunters, lions hunt in pride&amp;#39;s and use numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should the lion have the title over the tiger?
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_versus_lion#:%7E:text=The%20lion%20is%20usually%20a,while%20the%20tiger%20is%20solitary.&amp;amp;text=While%20male%20lions%20are%20generally,solitary%2C%20though%20they%20do%20socialize.&quot;&gt;wiki comparison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I go to school about ten mins from where the shooting happened in Atlanta, not that that makes this any more or less relevant. It&amp;#39;s a terrible, racially motivated tragedy. But nobody who&amp;#39;s racist is going to see #stopasianhate or #blm or whatever and think, damn it, you know, they&amp;#39;re right--I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; stop being racist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People post these things to let their followers (people who agree with them) know what a good person they are. It makes them feel good. But it accomplishes nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I work with a couple bigoted pricks. Jews and banks, 13/50, the IQ gap, Trump, adrenochrome, women suck, Tim Poole, the whole schebang. The thing is, despite their shit political views, they&amp;#39;re actually pretty fun to talk to, and I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; with them, but I treat them like human beings despite making it clear their politics are wrong... But I engage with them. If most of the people I saw on Twitter met a person like this they&amp;#39;d raise hell and get them fired from their job, but I genuinely think it&amp;#39;s important to engage with racists as if they&amp;#39;re normal human beings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely, I&amp;#39;m whittling at their racism. I dunno if I&amp;#39;ll ever do it, but I think that being probably the only pot smoking, guitar-playing, bdsm-participating pansexual leftie to treat their politics seriously is going to change their minds on what the left is all about. &lt;em&gt;I got them to admit that poor white people perform just as bad on IQ tests as poor blacks, and ditto for middle class and rich black and white people&lt;/em&gt;! To me, that&amp;#39;s a huge win! I don&amp;#39;t disagree with most of the points they make, just try to reframe them in a way that... Isn&amp;#39;t racist. It sounds worse than it is. It&amp;#39;s like, when they say &amp;quot;Jewish&amp;quot; people are destroying the world, I say, &amp;quot;well what about all the white and black and asian and latino people destroying the world?&amp;quot; And I think that will resonate. Marx said that the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; working class has to come together to destroy oppression (not a direct quote), and I truly believe we&amp;#39;re in an era where lefties and righties see that the elite are the enemy of progress. You just gotta get somewhere close to the same page. My dad&amp;#39;s a trump supporter, I&amp;#39;m a regretful biden voter (because who the fuck else was I going to vote for?) We both agree that he pays too much in taxes. He complains taxes should be cut; I complain that if he was making four times as much as he did he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay taxes at all, and he totally agrees. We all hate the same people, and that&amp;#39;s how you combat racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far right ideologies prey on your insecurities (well, not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; insecurities) and they give a way for sad white losers to feel like, at least they aren&amp;#39;t the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; losers by speaking from platitudes on civilization and shit. All that is a distraction from the world at large. If we can frame their political dissatisfaction from a place where we can show them that somewhere in leftism, and especially anti-authoritarianism is a place for their concerns to be heard if they just give up the racism, we can truly make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion/TLDR: hashtags don&amp;#39;t stop racism. Making friends does. Next time you meet a racist, think, who wants me to hate this person?&lt;/p&gt;

The common response to this is usually ‘tax the hell out of them.’ While I agree that’s what should happen I don’t think it will realistically happen because so many religious people will put up a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do think is more realistic is to get rid of the church IRS filing altogether and just lump them in with regular secular non profits. Why is this so important? Because non profits have to do one key thing that churches don’t; open their books to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many mega churches have been embroiled in scandals regarding misuse of funds to get the pastor a boat or a new house and the reason this gross injustice carries on is because of the law that states churches don’t need to open their books to the government. This essentially gives them free reign to do whatever they want with their money with no accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know there’s gonna be a bunch of people in my mentions saying ‘Ok you make a good point but having the church hand over their books to the IRS is a violation of church and state!’ And you couldn’t be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People only trot out the ‘violates separation of church and state’ phrase when they want churches to be exempt from laws the rest of us have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they wanted to make a law to force priests to break the seal of confession if somebody reports a crime, people cried ‘separation of church and state!’ to protect the Catholic Church and make sure they don’t follow the laws. They essentially think the seal of confession and the Catholic church’s archaic rules are more important than following the laws while living in this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the church operates as a charity in the eyes of the IRS, they should have all the responsibilities of a charity in the US with no special exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, the experience is valuable, but there are plenty of kids that cannot afford to work for free because they need money, no matter how valuable the internship is. Kids that are in college and don’t have any money besides what they’re earning don’t have the opportunity to get valuable internships because they have to make money to survive. If the internship is unpaid, it’s not only a rip-off, but it’s a huge disadvantage to the less well-off kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if there weren’t exceptions for internships, they would violate multiple labor laws that say you’re not allowed to take advantage of people and make them work for free. Why those exceptions exist is beyond me. &lt;/p&gt;

And I can see the difference between systemic and institutional racism.
However, this doesn&amp;#39;t help in the fact that racism and discrimination is considered right, no matter who it&amp;#39;s against.
My view is not changed as of yet but thank you all for the opinion-changing comments  you have provided for me to think on.
My fellow redditors, you&amp;#39;re amazing.
Let&amp;#39;s change this world together, no matter our race and what side were on.
(Also, some of you really need to read the post properly, my opinion is that racism to every person, not just white people, is wrong) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously, a hell of a lot of people disagree with racism. 
It&amp;#39;s stupid, disgusting and ignorant to be a racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you then decide that it&amp;#39;s okay to be racist towards a white person because they&amp;#39;re white, you&amp;#39;re an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re encouraging racism, not fixing it.
You&amp;#39;re encouraging ignorance, not fixing it.
You&amp;#39;re not being supportive at all to the people who do experience racism, you&amp;#39;re enabling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think you&amp;#39;re clever by saying that whites can&amp;#39;t be affected by racism because &amp;quot;wHiTe Is NoT a ColOuR&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, news fucking flash... Nobodies skin is white, like literally. Hold up a piece of plain white paper to a million healthy people and I can guarantee that you will not find a match.
(Barre albino which some may argue are completely white - still not true)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re making this world worse even if you sit at home thinking you deserve a fuckin medal because you upset a white person today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes out to all the self hating caucasians aswell.
Stop blaming each other for what happened in history and start changing the world properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a caucasian that thinks all caucasians are privallaged then stop going to your expensive schools and use that money to give to minorities.. then, and only then can you say you&amp;#39;ve done something alright &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quit screaming that racism is wrong to then encourage it in the next sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
