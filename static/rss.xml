On Reddit&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reddiquette&amp;quot; page, it says that &amp;quot;if you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. &amp;quot;  This makes complete sense to me, and I think this is the way that we should handle ourselves on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as a word with an originally intended meaning can come to mean something else over time, the downvote button is not just for when a post doesn&amp;#39;t contribute to a subreddit.  It is specifically for when you dislike or don&amp;#39;t agree with something that someone has posted, despite the original intent of the button.  Here are some thoughts as to why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button, though originally intended to be for rewarding posts that &amp;quot;contribute to conversation,&amp;quot; is widely accepted as the &amp;quot;I like this&amp;quot; button.  Though it too has deviated from its original purpose, the upvote button&amp;#39;s new purpose is accepted because it&amp;#39;s not problematic.  It&amp;#39;s a reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upvote button was intended to be the opposite of the downvote button, and in all ways, it appears to still be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I can tell, the vast majority of people who use the downvote button at all use it on posts they dislike.  If people use something a certain way, then that is what it is for.  The birth control pill was not originally intended as a contraceptive, but now, it is absolutely a contraceptive.  The company that makes Q-tips specifically doesn&amp;#39;t want you putting them in your ears, but Q-tips are absolutely ear-cleaners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;ll say that I absolutely believe that the downvote button should be used for its originally intended purpose.  It&amp;#39;s important to be exposed to ideas that we&amp;#39;re not comfortable with, and downvoting valid posts hides valid opinions, stopping others from learning from them.  My view here is simply that the downvote button has a very distinct purpose at this time: it is for punishing a post that you dislike or disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;

Grass in general can be very difficult upkeep, on the grass on courses especially so. I imagine more than any other Sport since the quality of the grass really determines the quality of the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average golf course is 150 acres, with roughly 2 million acres. This is all land that is cultivated with the aforementioned watering plus the mowing and fertilizing. All of that land could be used for other resources that are more efficient (yes that can be said about any sport as it’s not technically a necessity, but still that is so much land dedicated to relatively few people). Even if that were turf instead of grass that is still in an enormous area dedicated to the single sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think most sporting events are wasteful as far as their usage of space, so referencing that other sports waste resources too isn’t the point, unless any other sport is more wasteful, especially considering per person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not certain if this view is particularly controversial, or if people does argue against it for the sake of arguing. But I am curious of people genuinely disagree with this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that should be the case in the US (and the world, ideally).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are antivax, I believe that shows an unacceptable level of ignorance, inability to critically think and disregard for the actual science of medical treatment, if you still want to be a physician or nurse (or NP or PA or RT etc.)  (And I believe this also should include mandatory compliance with all vaccines currently recommended by the medical science at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by merit of having a license, you are in the position to be able to influence others, especially young families who are looking for an authority to tell them how to be good parents.  Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a new mother I was &amp;quot;vaccine hesitant&amp;quot;.  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn&amp;#39;t do hep B then I don&amp;#39;t think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn&amp;#39;t think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought &amp;quot;natural immunity&amp;quot; was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; something wasn&amp;#39;t perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to school after I had my second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; they hadn&amp;#39;t had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It&amp;#39;s laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there&amp;#39;s just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsure whether they&amp;#39;d be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I&amp;#39;m on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of weight.  If you don&amp;#39;t want to believe in medicine, that&amp;#39;s fine, you don&amp;#39;t get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we&amp;#39;re at it, but antivax is a good place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tldr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find holes in my logic, but I&amp;#39;m biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn&amp;#39;t  :)&lt;/p&gt;

I want to preface that I&amp;#39;m not saying anything about the day itself or any reasons for celebrating it, just criticizing the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the name doesn&amp;#39;t tell anything about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s celebrated. As someone who&amp;#39;s originally not from the US hearing &amp;quot;tomorrow is Juneteenth&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t tell me anything about why I should care about it. In this regard e.g. Black Independence Day or Emancipation Day (both from Wikipedia) would be superior names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the name doesn&amp;#39;t even specify a particular day. Every June day from the thirteenth to nineteenth would form the same portmanteau (June + *teenth). If the name only specified the month (e.g. June Day, similar to May Day) it wouldn&amp;#39;t be as bad, but as it stands there is a certain kind of fake precision implied.&lt;/p&gt;

I am willing to deal with possible disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

This seems to be rooted in some sort of insecurity and jealousy that (primarily) girls have relating to their self perception / self-esteem.  I have read countless threads and comments about how guys should respect the girls opinion and try to find a way to communicate, which I agree with but these comments and threads never mention how this issue seems to come from an area of insecurity.  There are however two sides to this coin, the guys on the other end don&amp;#39;t seem to understand this issue and often seem like assholes about it and lack communication from what I&amp;#39;ve read.  For example, the gf would ask the bf to unfollow seomgirls because it made them feel uncomfortable, but the guy will make countless excuses about the issue like how the girl is being insecure and invaildate the girls feelings.  This is not okay and not my point, my point is to recognize the underlying issue, which I haven&amp;#39;t heard talked about at all and try to fix it.  This issue of insecurity and jealousy and how it arises is another topic of discussion.  Can someone explain to me why I&amp;#39;m wrong or provide another perspective.  As a guy myself, I dont really feel this insecurity and jealousy and this post isn&amp;#39;t suppose to be a generalization of all women, but I&amp;#39;ve primarily just seen women bring up this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

He has already gone to prison three times since then and escaped every time. Recently he killed a whole family in Brasília, and the police is still looking for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no death penalty in Brazil and I’m very convinced that this “extreme” measure would end with all the panic it’s been going on in the last weeks here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably some would argue that “everyone deserves a second chance”, or (that’s very popular actually) “he is a society’s victim” or “let’s rehabilitate instead of punishing”; but, seriously, the authorities even lost the count of the amount of crimes this guy has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lázaro should’ve already been killed before and should EVEN MORE be killed now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just an example to illustrate my point of what the lack of this penalty can cause. Brazilian goverment yet hasn’t applied the penalty and that’s very upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct military action against the PRC is suicidal because they have nuclear weapons. Even if they didn&amp;#39;t, who would be willing to sacrifice millions (if not tens of millions) of their countrymen to liberate the Uyghurs? Also, in the last 20 years, military actions by Western nations have resulted in horrific failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;we need to set an example that genocide isn&amp;#39;t OK&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, the PRC constantly brings up Western nations&amp;#39; atrocities to claim that we have no right to criticize them, and imply that genocides are OK because we did genocides too. This not only makes the PRC look heroic to its populace, it also makes Westerners question if we do have any right to criticize the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCP has a strong grip on power. Many of its citizens remember poverty within their own lifetimes, and are grateful to the CCP for uplifting them out of poverty (regardless of whether or not the CCP deserves such credit). Plus, as mentioned in point #2, they take advantage of endless opportunities to deflect blame. If it didn&amp;#39;t have a strong grip on power, then it&amp;#39;s not long before another Chinese Civil War begins, which would not necessarily be good for Uyghurs, and would cause suffering all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racism and apathy against minorities exists everywhere, including in liberal democracies. There is no reason to believe that these problems don&amp;#39;t exist in the PRC too. What hope is there in fixing a racism problem if there is no will to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My country, Australia, has a severe economic dependence on exporting to the PRC. Most other countries have the PRC among their top 3 trading partners. We have reached a point where it is economic suicide to boycott or sanction the PRC. And before you tell me &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;why not boycott or sanction the USA for its atrocities&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, the same deal applies there (and that&amp;#39;s not even getting into Australia&amp;#39;s own shameful history). The most powerful countries can get away with almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PRC has managed economic growth despite the ongoing pandemic. Aside from Australia and New Zealand, most Western countries have been hit very hard by the pandemic, both in terms of GDP decline and deaths. Even if the PRC is covering up the truth about its pandemic deaths, the pandemic has accelerated the decline of Western nations in terms of economic, cultural, diplomatic and military power. Even if the PRC were lying about its economic growth, it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that all other nations have been weakened by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this very sub, we get a lot of people claiming &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;the PRC will hit a brick wall because of a housing bubble / middle income trap / aging population / corruption&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Yet this crash never comes. It makes me believe that the CCP has found a way to somehow dodge the consequences of these problems, a way that none of us westerners have figured out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a member of &lt;a href=&quot;/r/EnoughCommieSpam&quot;&gt;r/EnoughCommieSpam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/EnoughWumaoSpam&quot;&gt;r/EnoughWumaoSpam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/Shitwehraboossay&quot;&gt;r/Shitwehraboossay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/Shitracistssay&quot;&gt;r/Shitracistssay&lt;/a&gt; because I oppose totalitarianism, racism and genocide. I would love to have hope, but deep down, I know that there is no hope, so I try to pretend there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: In case someone tells me &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;concern about the Uyghurs is virtue signalling&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;people only care about the Uyghurs because it&amp;#39;s trendy to do so&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s irrelevant. Whether or not these accusations are true doesn&amp;#39;t affect my opinion that there is no hope about the situation of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that in the U.S. the servers are paid $2 an hour and they need to make up their pay in tips but let’s talk about where tipping culture has taken us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you get coffee or a cookie from a bakery, the credit card machine asks for a tip. The cashier stares at you, and you have to manually click “other” and select 0. The pressure and looks you receive, simply because you don’t want to pay someone for DOING THEIR JOB. I should not feel pressured to pay extra so the cashier can grab a pre-made cookie and put it in a bag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen the argument “you are paying for a service”, does that mean we should tip the person helping us find a pair of pants in the store? Should we tip the customer service workers in grocery stores for bagging our milk? Should anyone other than an employer be paying the worker? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked in fast food and clothing retail and never once expected to get paid by the customer FOR DOING MY JOB THAT I CHOSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the low pay, in Canada they used to pay servers $2 less than minimum wage, now they are paying them the same as minimum wage, yet tipping is still expected. There is no reason for tipping culture here since servers are being paid enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. I have seen people say that your employer will make up what you don’t get in tips. So that means everyone is still getting paid a fair wage right? So what’s the point? Why is tipping now becoming mandatory for other services as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to speak my mind on social media and I engage into discussions with people on both sides.  I have come to the conclusion that while the left has its issues, every person that I speak to that is right wing in my personal opinion seems to be misled.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 1:
     It recently popped into my head that there is no reputable news source that posts conservative content, I listen to NPR, BBC, Al Jazeera and I watch David Pakman and Secular talk on youtube.  There is no mainstream conservative outlet aside from fox, which is just not factual content, it is only fear mongering and propaganda.  I have watched the daily wire and louder with crowder and while they are well spoken and not necessarily propaganda, it seems to me that they only seek to disprove liberals and that is their only agenda.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 2:
     My closing statement in the last point brings me to this thought, when Trump was president what legislation were they pushing forward, i guess that you could say things like tax cuts and deregulation are a part of the conservative agenda, but i don’t see conservatives advocating for anything or making calls to action.  To put simply, there is no platform for conservatism and they have no goals aside from opposing liberals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point 3:
     My conclusion is that those that are republican legislators truly only have the interest of generating wealth inequality and those that support them only do because they either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do not actually get informed, they only use social media platforms and segments or their family members/community to form their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they watch fox news, which is truly only propaganda and a tool for persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Like the practice of tipping, guys paying for the girl isn’t inherently required but there are currently strong social norms pressuring for it. Up until now I’ve been footing the bill on the first date, but I’m recently becoming of the opinion that first dates should always be split. Here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In this time and age, men and women are equal and so it’s only fair that both are contributing to the dating experience, including the financial cost of it. Any argument for why the guy should pay for the first date, why can it not equally apply to women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If I, as a guy, pay for first dates, that’s essentially indirect prostitution. I may not be buying sex outright and no one is entitled to sex just because they paid for the other person, but sex is something many guys have in the back of the minds when offering to pay. Otherwise why pay for the first date because after all no one consistent foots the entire bill when they hang out with another friend for the first time? The closest analogy I have to this point is buying escorts. Although escorting is illegal and is legally considered prostitution, you’re technically not buying sex directly even though the intent is there. “Technically” you’re just buying the girl’s time and if sex happens then it happens but an escort doesn’t inherently owe you sex because you paid only for her time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Most dates, in my experience, don’t progress past the first date even if I think the first date went great from my perspective. For a random first date, if I pay for that date I have a decent likelihood of not getting a return on that investment. I’m not referring to sex here, but rather a second date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Not paying on the first date helps weed out gold diggers so I’m not wasting time/money on several dates before realizing the girl is a gold digger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only instances a guy should pay for the girl on the first date are if 1) he suggests an upscale or otherwise expensive date or 2) the guy genuinely wants to treat the girl (for ex, maybe if they were friends before)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common argument I’m expecting to hear is that whoever asks the other person out should pay for the date. I strongly disagree with this for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The vast majority of women do not ask men out for a first date. Yes, some women do but most of them will not. Even if the woman wants a date, the typical women will likely just wait for the man to make the first move in asking her out rather than directly asking the man out herself. So I’m practice this argument essentially automatically becomes the guy almost always paying for the first date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) When you invite another friend to hang out with you, it’s typically expected that each person will pay for themselves. Why is it any different for dating regardless of who asks out who as long as the date is not overly expensive? If the guy suggests a date that the girl cannot afford, the girl should either directly state that it’s out of her budget, offer an alternative suggestion that is within budget, or decline the date altogether. The girl should not automatically assume the date will be paid for by the guy.&lt;/p&gt;

He stepped on women to do it.  Literally, is a whole thread about nothing but bringing down men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a biracial male in the Deep South I can tell you this much, the last thing I need is to be discriminated against by women for my gender when I already have people doing that for my skin color. And yet that’s another thing that seems to completely go over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve worked in the restaurant industry and make sure to always tip well. However, I don&amp;#39;t like the common idea of tipping 15-20%  of your bill. For instance, one would tip their waiter $10 if they get a  $50 plate (going with 20% tip here). But tip the same waiter, in the same restaurant,  $4 if they ordered a $20 plate instead . In both instances, you are getting the same quality of food, same service, and the waiter is doing the same amount of work. It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me to have to give such a larger tip for the same amount of work only because I decided to get a more expensive dish/drink.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re people who slipped through the net. Dropped out of school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nah I don’t buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, everyone gets access to an education. The people coming out of the woodwork as anti-vaxxers aren’t those from working class families. Those with working class upbringings are far too busy making a living and enjoying their lives than to find time peddling conspiracies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly antivaxxers are from middle class white upbringings. They had simple upbringings and limited life experiences. With everything handed to them on a plate, they never struggled for anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardship for them growing up was having their Nintendo taken away from them, or having no pocket money for a week because they didn’t go to church. The same kids who later on spent too much of their student loan on crack and had to ring home to mummy and daddy so they had enough money for an Uber home from the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this endless life of nothing, of mediocrity, of underachieving because you had no reason to strive for better ultimately leads to very unhappy people. No meaning to life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic gave these privileged losers the illusion of hardship, of oppression. Who else would see a mask as oppressive? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the Holocaust survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the domestic abuse survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the refuge, homeless and stateless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illusion of hardship has done something very strange to their brains. It’s given their life meaning. Not in the same way most people perceive “meaning” but a purpose of a sort still. When people feel oppressed they find ways of resisting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly they feel unique and special as they find other people online who feel the same. They can send each other their “research” - various opinion pieces disguised as peer reviewed research or even referencing real research taken out of context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down many of them know they’re living a fantasy, but they don’t care because they’re part of a unique underground resistance. They’re not mediocre like their parents - they’re doing something really special with their lives. They never believed in something bigger than themselves before which is the reason why they’re so difficult to reason with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solution?&lt;/strong&gt; isn’t better education. We all have access to education it just depends whether you choose to ignore what you learnt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never give your kids a ride, an easy life: A passionless existence. Because they will find something truly fucked up to fill that void. Drug addiction, alcoholism or the absolute worst: A passion for Anti-Vax or other truth denialism.&lt;/p&gt;

From my knowledge, most government initiatives for reducing obesity and improving nutrition/exercise knowledge have focused on children in schools. I definitely believe that health/nutrition is important and should be taught in schools as well, but I think that workplace interventions would be more effective for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children are not responsible for dietary decisions. Even if they share what they learn about healthy eating with their parents, it does not mean that they will buy or cook healthier food. By the time the children become adults, they will have likely forgotten a lot of what they have learned and will need to brush up on health information anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children have less executive functioning ability and are more likely to give in to immediate gratification than adults. Of course children are capable of making healthy decisions, but to be realistic, most children will eat junk food if it is available to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workplaces are the ideal place to have interventions because most adults in North America work, so they are there anyway. Even if community programs are available, adults need to find the time, transportation, money, etc. to be able to attend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a built-in social support network because you can attend meetings with your coworkers and engage in workplace events like healthy potlucks or group exercises. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I support grants to restaurants that serve healthy food etc., but nutrition education is important to help people make decisions about what/where to eat in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of nutrition misinformation among adults. Fad diets and unsustainable weight loss plans are common. A lot of nutrition research is behind paywalls or written in a way that is difficult for people that aren&amp;#39;t experts to understand, and evidence about best practices has changed over time as research methods have improved. Therefore, I believe it is important to have professionals &amp;quot;translate&amp;quot; nutrition/exercise information into resources that are easily understood by the lay person and provide clear ways to take action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I believe that government resources designated to fight obesity should be largely allocated to offering interventions at workplaces. I believe the hardest part would be getting employers on board. However, for a lot of businesses, a one hour session every week or two is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on output. Even sessions offered immediately after work would be more accessible than community programs. It might help to get employers on board if they take the perspective that improved health in their employers would reduce sick days, money used for benefits, physical injuries, and even improve mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villain is an unstoppable force with a singular understandable motivation, and while not having an incredible amount of character is still one of the most iconic villains ever created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film balance is practical effects and CGI to quite near perfection. It was done so well that it still holds up to today’s standards. On top of all of this the film is complemented by a great score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be controversial enough of an opinion, but I was mainly curious to see what other films people consider to be good contenders. I’m not trying to be too technical people consider this more of a sci-fi thriller or sci-fi action or whatever a sub genre, if we can consider this in a general sense in action film I would say it is one of the greatest&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for this, I understand, is historical. Eye doctors/optometrists aren&amp;#39;t educated at the same facilities as ophthalmologists and the professions were historically considered separate. However, I don&amp;#39;t think it makes sense that traditional health insurance plans in the USA don&amp;#39;t cover vision care. Arguments I have heard for why this makes sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t use vision insurance, so adding it in would drive up premiums unnecessarily. I don&amp;#39;t think this makes sense at all. Most people won&amp;#39;t require *most* services that their health insurance plans cover. I have never needed a cardiologist, a radiologist, or a dermatologist, but if I did, my health insurance plan would cover it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision insurance isn&amp;#39;t medically necessary; you won&amp;#39;t die just because you can&amp;#39;t see well. I think this argument is made primarily by people who don&amp;#39;t have poor vision. I do have poor vision, and my glasses/contact lenses allow me to live a normal life. It&amp;#39;s just as medically necessary for my health and happiness as a hearing aid or prosthetic. I could not function independently without my glasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision care is relatively cheap, so most people can afford it on their own, so it isn&amp;#39;t an injustice that it isn&amp;#39;t covered. Perhaps, but it&amp;#39;s still a huge hassle to have to shell out a couple hundred dollars every year for something I need to function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only argument I&amp;#39;ve ever heard that even remotely makes sense to me is that eye care is usually a very predictable, fixed cost every year, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t make economic sense to cover it. For example, insurance companies know that it will cost them about $100 per person with vision deficiencies per year, so they will try to get each of those people to pay in about $100 each for the benefits, which then defeats the purpose of the insurance policy for the customer, as they will be just as well off paying for the services directly themselves. The thing I don&amp;#39;t understand is why this argument is applied to vision insurance and nothing else. For example, I could see it being quite predictable that women of child-bearing age will each cost an insurance company $500 every three years for pap smears--thus insurance companies would try to raise prices to recoup those costs--and then the insurance plan would no longer really be a viable option for the customer. But it only seems to happen for optometry and other services considered medically unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually am generally extremely pleased with my health insurance, but this one baffles me. Other than for historical reasons, why can&amp;#39;t I get vision care through my insurance? Why can I get so many services for free but when I need glasses, I&amp;#39;m left scouring weird websites hunting for deals? Why does this system make sense at all? Someone please CMV.&lt;/p&gt;

The article might say something like &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; posted several tweets from 2012-14&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; has apologised for their comments&amp;#39;, and may include comments from other people in response to the original offending posts, but the posts themselves are typically not included. In my opinion, this is extremely unhelpful and failing to fulfil a pretty basic requirement of being a news outlet. If the focus of the article is what the person has said, then surely including what they actually said is pretty essential. And how are readers supposed to know how to feel about the comments or the commenter if they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;ve actually said?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be an argument in favour of omitting the comments on the grounds that the media outlets do not want to provide a &amp;#39;platform&amp;#39; or be otherwise associated with crude or offensive language. But this standard only seems to really apply to archaic social media posts. If, for example, a famous person made crude/offensive comments today in an interview or press conference, most media outlets would report what they said verbatim. Indeed, even &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; social media posts by famous people don&amp;#39;t get this treatment. For example, here&amp;#39;s a BBC article from 2019 about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48306223&quot;&gt;the rugby player Israel Folau&amp;#39;s homophobic post on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. The article quotes the post verbatim. Meanwhile, here is a recent article from the BBC about cricketer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/57379184&quot;&gt;Ollie Robinson being suspended for historical racist and sexist tweets&lt;/a&gt;. This article does not make any mention of the exact content of Robinson&amp;#39;s tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing IMO would be for the media to include the original posts in their reports. If necessary, they can add some kind of warning that the content may be upsetting, or a disclaimer that these views do not represent the views of the outlet in question (although I sort of assumed all quotes in news reports came with that implication anyway), but reporting in as much detail and with as much accuracy as possible seems like a pretty basic part of publishing any form of news.&lt;/p&gt;

My fingers have been married to a keyboard since my early teens, and as I make the climb through my late 20s, I am starting to feel the effects of constantly sitting down. Earlier this week, I came to the decision that I needed to make some changes for the sake of my health, and I started researching to find the best standing desk options. I parsed through dozens of written reviews and a equal measure of video reviews on sites like YouTube and I found one common thread among many of them. The person or persons reviewing the product did not actually purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They either had it sent after they requested a &lt;em&gt;review copy&lt;/em&gt; (which is a whole other conversation), and were propositioned by the company to review their product in exchange for a free model. Some of the sites that featured these sponsored reviews were fairly popular, as were the videos, so it was obvious these so called opinion pieces were getting plenty of attention. But how genuine can an opinion on a product be, when you got the product for free? Under no circumstance should anyone be allowed to post reviews of free products, and especially when they don&amp;#39;t even disclose the product was free outright. During my foray into the office supply side of YouTube I encountered many reviewers using semantic sleight of hand to get around just saying they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;did not purchase the item&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[Company] reached out to me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I collaborated with [company] to&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks to [Company] for being a part of this video&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all is revealed in the description of the video where they, likely due to fear of legal or platform trouble, place a disclaimer stating they did not purchase the product. If they were honest they would start of the video by stating clearly, &amp;quot;This item was sent to me for free by [company]&amp;quot;, but they know this would degrade the usefulness of their review, and for good reason. The main thing that brought me to my current conclusion is how these sponsored reviews poison the well of information a consumer has to shift through in order to make an informed choice. You might say: &amp;quot;Just ignore them&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take it with a grain of salt&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t think that is enough. There is a real harm that comes from having so many reviews on sites like YouTube with millions of hits that are essentially paid testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me provide a scenario.: I am a YouTuber with a growing channel centered around tech reviews, news, gaming, etc. I decide I want to upgrade my setup and get more desk space, so I research around and decide to by a standing desk. It cost around $500 and 30 minutes of my time in assembly. When I decide to review this desk, I will have in my mind the amount I spent, and will be making near constant comparisons between it and the value it does or does not provide. &amp;quot;For $500, I really expected better stability&amp;quot;, or similar statements. I am not just reviewing a product. I am in real time justifying or lamenting over my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for completion, let&amp;#39;s imagine what the other side my might look like: I am a popular YouTuber with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. I am routinely asked by major and minor companies to review their products in my videos, often at no cost to me. I receive &lt;em&gt;review copies&lt;/em&gt; which unbeknownst to me, may be quality controlled especially carefully and maybe even tweaked to an extent that they do not represent the product a regular consumer will receive. Sometimes I am the one doing the requesting, but in either case, I pay nothing. When I review a desk, there is no careful consideration regarding whether the money I spent was worth it, because I didn&amp;#39;t spend any. My comparisons are cold and unfeeling because the entire thing was one big transaction, and my review is being compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not get honesty from the latter scenario. There may be some paid reviewers who try to be truthful in there reviews but the conflict of interest is far too great to ignore, and if you ask me, is criminal in a lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while it was the standing desk research that brought this issue to the forefront of my mind, most of what I discussed in this post is directly, if not perfectly applicable to other consumer products. Tech, clothing, art supplies, shoelaces, the little plastic tips you put on shoelaces, shoes, lace, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

You can&amp;#39;t simultaneously teach the most extreme forms of trans acceptance and that gender roles are harmful social constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, we&amp;#39;re trying to open up our society to all of these different ways that people can and do identify. That is a good thing. I&amp;#39;m down for radical tolerance. However, we&amp;#39;re also trying to instill the fact that gender expression is a societal phenomena, which can be restrictive and harmful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this creates a paradox. It&amp;#39;s like this &amp;quot;gender roles are a social construct, you don&amp;#39;t have to base your behavior or identity on them. But, if you don&amp;#39;t identify with society&amp;#39;s portrayal of this gender, you&amp;#39;re probably some other gender.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this presents a huge problem. Are we attempting so hard to be accepting to non-traditional genders, that we&amp;#39;re failing at destroying gender roles? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care because my daughter might come to me some day, questioning her assigned gender. Do I tell her that identifying with &amp;quot;boy&amp;quot; things doesn&amp;#39;t make her a boy, or do I tell her it&amp;#39;s okay if she feels more like a boy than a girl?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind could be changed if someone presented me with a fairly concrete definition, which explains the differences between these things. Thanks for your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thank you, everyone, for the civility and understanding. I was really worried I might come off as transphobic, and y&amp;#39;all have showed me a lot of patience. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find this advice useless for two reasons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am lazy and lack confidence. If I was being myself, I would avoid social situations altogether. If I can&amp;#39;t avoid them, I would either not say a word, or I would talk about nerdy (i.e. video games) or controversial (i.e. economics or politics) topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice is too vague and general, and it accomplishes nothing. If someone is struggling with a math problem, you wouldn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;just apply the math you learned in class&amp;quot;. You would understand what specific shortcoming is causing them to have issues solving the problem, and target that shortcoming with your advice. So better advice would be structured like &amp;quot;I think you should brush up on U-substitution. That should help you with these types of integration problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;

So, please forgive me if this does not make much sense and please know that I&amp;#39;m more than ready to change my view, or at least have it adjusted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it seems to me that a lot of American media has no idea what &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; means.  Here&amp;#39;s an article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/real-radicals-arent-washington-opinion-1591769&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (since when is &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;, by the way?) talking about &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; billionaire George Soros.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far-left billionaire?  That&amp;#39;s like having a Nazi rabbi.  You can&amp;#39;t be far-left and a billionaire.  If you are truly &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt;-left, then you oppose private property and seek the overthrow of existing systems of power.  There cannot be a &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; billionaire.  Billionaires are by definition members of the exploiting class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there cannot be a &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot; Hollywood or Silicon Valley agenda.  Hollywood and Silicon Valley exist to cash-in on on vanity and narcissism.  They are the antithesis of far-leftism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would admit that Hollywood writers, Silicon Valley moguls and certain billionaire financiers are &lt;em&gt;liberals,&lt;/em&gt; and that they use their considerable power and influence to oppose traditional interpretations of sexuality, gender and race.  I would also concede that this probably infuriates a lot of religious and nationalist conservatives but this does not make them &amp;quot;far-left&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, true &amp;quot;radical leftists&amp;quot; would oppose identity politics outright and would see it as something conjured up by elites to distract the working classes from their blatant exploitation by profit-driven capitalists.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have this right.  I&amp;#39;m not saying where I stand on any of these issues but can anyone honestly say that a true &amp;quot;far-leftist&amp;quot; would support anything produced by media conglomerates, tech magnates and billionaire financiers?  Am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless my curiosity has overtaken my fear, which is why I&amp;#39;m here. I don&amp;#39;t mean to be disrespectful in any way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is relevant to my stance in any way, I belong to a minority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone asks that people support a business, simply because that business is owned by someone of a certain race, they&amp;#39;re doing a number of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active acknowledgment that the owner belongs to a certain race. This within itself is not necessarily racist (depending on how narrow the definition of &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; is), but the distinction has been made. They are singling out certain businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a suggestion being made that these businesses aren&amp;#39;t doing as well because they are owned by people of a certain race. Am I wrong if I think this suggestion within itself is a form of racist stereotyping, unless it&amp;#39;s coupled with cited evidence of some form of economical analysis/statistical measure? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preference to support certain businesses over other businesses simply because of the owner&amp;#39;s race is inherently a choice made based on race, and is therefore racist. (For instance, if you choose to support a minority business instead of a white-owned business because of the minority factor, that can be construed as racist. And vice versa would be true as well.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought of racism as special treatment or consideration (either positive or negative) of one particular race over another. Is there a definition that fits better which would explain the thinking behind supporting businesses because they are owned by a specific race as a move away from racism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:
The majority of responses I have received touch upon 3 main points. I will generally respond to them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Being colourblind is not the answer to racism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a generous amount of research which suggests that it is literally impossible to escape implicit racial bias. Psychologically speaking the human brain subconsciously registers differences. For those of you speaking about the importance of diversity, I don&amp;#39;t disagree, but I will remind everyone that I am cautious to make this the centre of our discussion because I do not feel that race and culture are not the same thing, although they may be related and/or synonymous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a form of counterbalancing which we accept as a desirable and effective measure against racism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reluctant to give in to this argument because I think it&amp;#39;s sticky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obviously not the exact same thing, but it&amp;#39;s remniscient of the discussions we have had in the past about the appropriateness of paying reparations to African Americans on the basis of the fact that some of their ancestors being slaves in the past may have set them back generationally in terms of success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I don&amp;#39;t deny that the cycle of poverty is real, it seems racially (or generally, idk) insensitive to say we can balance stuff out simply by doing x.  Such behaviour comes with good intentions but it attempts to quantify the magnitude of other people&amp;#39;s suffering, which is problematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begets two further questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly: is it not racist to continually single the descendants of certain races out, and tell them that they aren&amp;#39;t doing as well because of their ancestors&amp;#39; past? Even if statistically this is true for a significant proportion of that population, applying the statement as a universal truth to all minority businesses seems like racial stereotyping to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: when, if ever, can we say we&amp;#39;ve done enough to right the wrong? Who are we to decide? Is it racist to think we can? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is related to the support small/local businesses movement&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on reddit - a rather leftist space - I have noticed a lot of people decrying any policy that is right of centre as fascist. I also particularly notice this on things like supporting Trump - trump supporters are automatically labelled racist extremists and fascists when in reality most are just regular folk (though I must admit that I have only met a very small number of pro-trump people, as I am not American and in my country we generally disliked trump well before he came to political prominence - I am just skeptical to think that about half of the USA are actually the way they are portrayed on reddit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you have to be aware of, especially in the current political climate and if your views are fairly far from centre, is that assumptions, reasoning, and logical steps that you will take for granted just dont apply to a lot of other people. I know and have befriended lots of people who diametrically oppose my politics and there are a few I can have really interesting discussions with, and whilst I often very severely disagree with them, I can see how their particular situation brought them to their conclusions. And so the best thing you can do to actually have a constructive conversation about this is to empathise and appeal to that line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What not to do is to just see that they have come to a conclusion that you don&amp;#39;t like and just assume that they are the worst version that they can possibly be. Sure, overt xenophobia is a lost cause and folks who practice that should be condemned because they aren&amp;#39;t reasonable. But to go back to the example of trump supporters, seeing only the crazies that invade the capitol building and tarring them all with the same brush is absolute nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it is exactly the same as people on the right claiming that e.g. universal healthcare is communism, or that people who want better wealth equity or racial justice as communists. They&amp;#39;re not. Sure, there are some tankies in there, and from my point of view they should be ignored and condemned too, but when I see the entire left being tarred with that brush I just think it&amp;#39;s an absolutely nonsensical and bad faith put down to try to avoid any actual discourse and instead just try to say &amp;quot;other side bad&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember - the folks who say that are also getting algorithmically fed only the examples of the very worst of the left such as destruction left by BLM protests and the least intelligent amongst the community. That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re fed of the left, and we know that we&amp;#39;re not actually like that. So don&amp;#39;t ignore that self-awareness and extend it to the folks on the right too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I realise that I am speaking to a primarily American crowd, but I used trump as a contemporary example and this point is not explicitly about him. Trump himself could ostensibly be labelled as fascist, but the point I am making is that being very slightly right of centre and voting a certain way because it&amp;#39;s your party and it aligns with your tax policy is not the same as being far right and voting trump because you hate black people and he will stop immigration. I know that the US electoral system bunches these people together, but that does not mean they&amp;#39;re all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not trying to make fun of anyone’s culture, every culture has their weirdnesses and shortcomings, my own (Denmark) included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in many cultures, teenagers aren’t allowed to have sex. My boyfriend was in exchange in the US when he was around 15 or 16, and he wasn’t even allowed to close the door to his room if a girl was in it. Sleepovers were a huge no-no, in fact it was laughable to even suggest. Teenagers would sneak out to do it in secret instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is wrong and in fact harmful for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they sneak out, they often do it in unsafe conditions like public toilets, shady motels or parking lots. If you had it at home, you would be safer and more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This approach to teenagers’ sexuality isn’t working. The US and U.K. (which has a pretty similar attitude to my knowledge) have higher teenage pregnancy rates than any country in mainland Europe (whose approach is generally more “they’re gonna do it anyway, why not at home”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your kid may be bi. What are you going to do, prevent close relationships/friendships in general?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were just some of the reasons that came to me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

This is because the fine is not a payment for an item, it&amp;#39;s supposed to be a punishment and a deterrent. If someone with no income has to pay a £50 fine, versus someone with millions in the bank, the amount of punishment they&amp;#39;re experiencing will be vastly different, even though they&amp;#39;ve done the same thing. I think in this situation it makes more sense to balance the level of punishment, than to have the same arbitrary cash amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ve just shown how little I understand the way the law and/or economics works, and I welcome anyone to fill me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;d like to clarify on what sort of system I&amp;#39;m envisioning - although I&amp;#39;m sure this has a few thousand issues itself.

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a celebrity makes an attempt to utilise characteristics of a culture that is not theirs, I often notice people bringing up &amp;#39;culture appropriation&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand this. There are million other points you could use to speak against a lot of celebrities but this one does not make any sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CULTURES ARE MEANT TO MIX. THEY ARE MEANT TO INTERMINGLE AND BRING FORTH NEW CULTURES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you mention the words &amp;#39;culture appropriation&amp;#39; in English, you&amp;#39;re calling out the appropriation by SPEAKING THE LITERAL KING OF APPROPRIATING OTHER LANGUAGES. There is little to nothing in the english language that is &amp;#39;english&amp;#39; per se but that&amp;#39;s completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary for cultures to interact, take the best aspects of each other and utilitise them. That&amp;#39;s how cultures grow. That&amp;#39;s how everything grows, im pretty sure that&amp;#39;s how genetic variation in animals works as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by saying that something is &amp;#39;appropriating&amp;#39; another culture, you&amp;#39;re cutting cultures off from one another and in a way gate keeping certain things from the global society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;ve worded my points well enough and would love to be proved wrong:)&lt;/p&gt;

If you mean the Neo-Marxist group Black Lives Matter, then no I don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;  The person started swearing at me and calling me a racist and I shrugged it off and moved on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t get it, the person thinks the BLM the group is BLM the concept and I think they&amp;#39;re 2 different things. BLM the group is a neo-Marxist organization that has a whole lot of fucked up things in their manifesto that I have 0 interest in agreeing with. If their entire manifesto read thusly. &amp;quot;Seeking to end systematic racism and promote black people as important to keep them safe from police and racists.&amp;quot; I would 100% support the organization. Instead up until like 2 months ago it was a leftist rant about how people need to redistribute wealth and how we&amp;#39;re oppressed by the rich. Things I just 1 don&amp;#39;t believe in and 2 will never support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying I don&amp;#39;t support an organization does not make me a racist, it means I don&amp;#39;t support that group. I have often encouraged people if they want to support Black Charities and black people to give to real organizations that do real work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naacpldf.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.naacpldf.org/&lt;/a&gt; is a great charity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncf.org/&quot;&gt;https://uncf.org/&lt;/a&gt; is another one.

&lt;p&gt;We already know that certain parts of the brain are responsible for certain functions, such as the  cerebrum. If we were to cut out the cerebrum, we would either destroy the patient&amp;#39;s ability to think, or we would destroy their consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if we were to remove the parts of the brain that interprets our senses, then we would lose those senses (sight, smell, etc). So we all agree that without the brain those senses evaporate, why would our consciousness, our being, or our person-hood be any different? Because if you have no sensation, no thinking, no mental/physical activity, what is the difference between that and someone who is &amp;#39;gone?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agree that those who have not yet been born do not exist because they have none of the above criteria (thoughts, sensations). What possible reason is there to think those who have died are in any different kind of state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to sum up: Due to our understandings of the brain, the belief in the afterlife can be dismissed as a childish fancy borne our of fear and grief. It is just as baseless, perhaps even more so, than believing any of the following: That skin colors make certain people superior/inferior, that vaccines cause autism, that the earth is flat, that your astrological sign determines your personality, that Lord of the Rings is historical fact, or that Elvis is alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted due to the existential nightmare we find ourselves in the belief in an afterlife, while being even more unfounded and irrational than any of the above, is much, much more forgivable and understandable, due to the above mentioned fear and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m wrong let me know. I&amp;#39;d love to have reasons to stop believing that we&amp;#39;re all destined for the void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: A few people have made the argument &amp;#39;But belief in the afterlife helps people act better/be happy, or in other ways make their lives better.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, but good effects say nothing about the truth values of their claims. Hence, I will not accept this answer.&lt;/p&gt;

I would never call someone out or insult someone for doing it, I just disagree. But my main opinion is that children who identify as trans should not be able to get the surgery. My reasoning for this is that
1. Its a child, they can&amp;#39;t make life changing choices, its really hard, and they might do something they regret later.
2. If they go through with it, they might be bullied, harassed, threatened. 
3. I don&amp;#39;t know how much trans surgery costs, but in America (even tho I&amp;#39;m pretty sure medically unnecessary surgeries are not free in other countries)
It most likely costs a ton of money. If this is a child, they can&amp;#39;t pay the bill, so their parents have to. They lose a ton of money, and if their child regrets it, it makes them unhappy, and could be a complete waste of money.
4. Kinda restating my first point, but I see grown adult trans people confused about what their gender is, and trying to figure it out. Now, instead of a stable adult, you make the adolescent hormonal teenager make the same choices. I don&amp;#39;t think they should transition medically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see trans kids being 16 and transitioning, anything under that, I wouldn&amp;#39;t support. I fully support them experimenting and wearing clothes of the opposite gender, and doing whatever to learn more about themselves. But I think they should wait until they are 16 or 18 to medically transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me if there is something I forgot about, or if you would just like to challenge my point. I&amp;#39;m a teenager myself, by the way. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Some think that it is simply a matter of how disrespectful the act is. Others believe that other factors, such as the oppressor-oppressed dynamics between the cultures that takes practices and the cultures from which they are taken, are important as well. I believe that, under all of these definitions, kimono and yoga do not qualify as cultural appropriation, unlike the Native American headdress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;: Japan was not a colonized nation; on the contrary, it was a brutal colonizer of east and southeast Asia for a while, and they also attacked the US first. The brief occupation of Japan by the US was less colonization and more like the Union occupation of the South during the Reconstruction era, or the defeat of the Boer colonists at the hands of the British Empire in South Africa. And while what the British Empire did to India was colonization, yoga comes from Brahmins, an oppressor of the lower castes; in fact, what we know as yoga today in the West was actually appropriated by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/philosophy/yoga-s-greater-truth/&quot;&gt;high caste Indian from lower caste practitioners&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the Native American headdress was taken from those who were almost unilaterally colonized. As such, kimono and yoga do not have the issue of power dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religious/ceremonial significance&lt;/strong&gt;: Kimono is just a clothing item that happens to be traditional. Western* yoga is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/philosophy/yoga-s-greater-truth/&quot;&gt;largely influenced from Scandinavian gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, from which Indians were inspired, and repackaged to be sold to the West. However, the Native American headdress has been an earned symbol of honor, and should not be taken for granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitudes of the members of the original culture&lt;/strong&gt;: Japan does not mind spreading kimono to the whole world because it sees it as part of its soft power, along with video games, anime, etc. Same with India, seeing how it was proactively promoted by Indians. Unlike these two, however, the Native headdress is largely agreed by the members of the Plains nations not to be worn around lightly, and due to the ceremonial significance mentioned above, the very act of wearing it without permission is considered disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*At this point, I think it&amp;#39;s more correct to call it &amp;quot;globalized&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot;, since yoga is rising in popularity in places like South Korea and South America as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been having this chat in real life with my GF, and I want to ask what you all think. 
I think we all heard the idea that personality is more important than looks when it comes to our SO. I simply don’t believe so. I do not believe that looks are more important of course, but I just believe the two are not mutually replaceable. I’m not arguing for objective beauty, but for personal taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an example, I personally wouldn’t date somebody with a great personality who I don’t find attractive. On the other hand, I wouldn’t date someone who’s stunning with a bad personality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seems demanding, but in my personal experience this has translated to a longer research for a stable partner, and to this day it worked amazingly for me. I also believe that when it comes to relationships we should never settle down for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

However I am also a cis girl, and the most I have of a second opinion are non binary friends that I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But basically the title. Non binary people aren&amp;#39;t really either men or women, and they shouldn&amp;#39;t be forced into those binary categories. Which is why I find it strange when non binary people call themselves lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: gender non conforming is not the same as non binary. Gender non conforming often means a person identifies as their gender assigned from birth, but has traits of a different gender (example: a male who likes to wear skirts) Non binary means a person identifies as something other than their birth gender but not the other binary gender either. Also, I think that demigirls are fine to use the label of lesbian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesbian by definition is a woman who loves women. Non binary people aren&amp;#39;t women. Wouldn&amp;#39;t trying to squeeze them into a label meant for women be transphobic? Because why would non binary people want to be seen as women if they&amp;#39;re not? I have a non binary friend who says that seeing other non binary people identify as lesbians just confuses them, and that they would feel so much dysphoria if they were to be considered a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who argue for non binary lesbians often say &amp;quot;if you&amp;#39;re AFAB (assigned female at birth) and attracted to only women, you&amp;#39;re a lesbian&amp;quot; But I can&amp;#39;t help but find that argument extremely transphobic. This argument would basically be saying that trans men who like girls are lesbians, and trans women who like girls aren&amp;#39;t, just because of what they we&amp;#39;re assigned at birth. Which I find disgusting, because trans people are completely valid and to minimize someone to their assigned gender at birth is puke worthy. Trans lesbians are lesbians, period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are those who say &amp;quot;lesbians are non men who love non men, and non binary people fit everywhere&amp;quot; and I personally hate this argument the most because this is not what a lesbian is. I understand the need for inclusivity, but I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with a label meant for me as a girl who likes other girls to be changed into something that revolves around the fact that it&amp;#39;s not being about other men. The point of lesbians is for it to NOT be about men, so why even edit this into the definition? I&amp;#39;m only attracted to women, not non binary people, and to expand the label to be more ambiguous just makes it more complicated. I find trying to argue that lesbian isn&amp;#39;t just for women is erasure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, people who say there&amp;#39;s a lack of better labels. That&amp;#39;s not true. Trixic (non binary loves women) and toric (non binary loves men) are kinda new I agree, but they&amp;#39;re both labels made specifically for the non binary community. Why would non binary people want to use a label for women (when they&amp;#39;re not) when there&amp;#39;s already labels for them as non binary people? Creating space for non binary people is important, but to just mash them with lesbians just because they also like girls is both confusing and even intrusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am well aware this opinion is controversial and that&amp;#39;s why I want to change it. I&amp;#39;m expecting the comments to be a mess and calling me a gatekeeper, but I want to see how everyone feels about this. I know there are lesbians who agree that it&amp;#39;s a women only label, and others that say that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be rigid. I fully support non binary people, and am not even stone set on this opinion. I am mainly just confused as to why those who are not women insist on calling themselves a woman only label, when there&amp;#39;s already other better fitting labels just for non binary people that don&amp;#39;t make things more complicated for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;hygienic&amp;quot; that way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because my religious book/authority says I should do it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pick those two apart shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one in their right mind would say that mutilation is an acceptable way of keeping good hygiene. We don&amp;#39;t pluck people&amp;#39;s fingernails so they don&amp;#39;t get dirt under them or remove their scalps so they don&amp;#39;t get lice and smell bad. If you teach your kid to  wash his penis and wear a condom when he&amp;#39;s old enough, there is no reason to chop off his foreskin for the sake of &amp;quot;hygiene&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you argue that it&amp;#39;s within your religious freedom to practice circumcision, I&amp;#39;d agree to the extent that you should be allowed to do it to yourself, BUT NOT TO YOUR CHILD. As a matter of fact, having your kid participate in any religious ritual should be illegal, but that&amp;#39;s a topic for a different CMV. Imagine this, one day you travel abroad and become gravely ill, to the point of being in a coma. When you wake up, a group of people tell you: Hey, we thought you weren&amp;#39;t gonna make it so we shaved your head and gave you some ritualistic tattoos because that&amp;#39;s what we do in our religion. Wouldn&amp;#39;t that make you feel violated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if we as a society agree that people should be in control of their own bodies we cannot justify the genital mutilation of people who do not consent to it. There&amp;#39;s a reason why all western countries have banned Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), it&amp;#39;s a horrible practice that deprives women of sexual pleasure for no good reason. It&amp;#39;s the same thing with male circumcision, the nerve endings on the foreskin contribute to sexual pleasure and removing the foresking because God or because hygiene is not a good reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that the only reason why circumcision is still legal is because if any one politician actively campaigned against it, his political party would lose a bunch of religious peoples&amp;#39; votes, that&amp;#39;s it. It&amp;#39;s legal because no political party wants to pay the price to make things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being naive, gullible and influence-able are not flaws. There is no point in proving his/her own originality, since homo sapiens is very social, and humans have been influencing each others just like most other animal species, since the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this new flag is just fundamentally ugly right? Like brown never looks good on a flag and you are taking an good iconic flag and turning it into something worse and for what reason ? LGBT people have often been excluded from spaces for people of colour and the reason why the death rate of black LGBT people is so shockingly high is because of people of colour.  It&amp;#39;s not like these two fights are interchangeable, the issues facing LGBT people and people of colour are pretty different and while most people who support one group normally support the other that&amp;#39;s not a good enough reason to make the core icon of LGBT community now be linked to people of colour complicating an already massive wheel house of different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support having the trans triangle because while of course the LGB and the trans community have a lot in common trans issues are also often separate from LGB issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride should be about gay issues and seeking LGBT rights it shouldn&amp;#39;t be diluted by what ever social issue the culture cares about that day. I would think it&amp;#39;s entirely inappropriate for LGBT people to go to black lives matter and say yeah I know you guys are all about people of colour issues but you need to also start talking about LGBT issues. Like no these movements need to stay focused otherwise they sputter out and die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a person of colour is not an core issue or part of the LGBT community. If a gay person could live their entire lives not knowing anything about the experience of people of colour why is it being included in their flag. Yeah I know that people of colour have not been given full credit in the LGBT movement and some key figures have been people of colour but having some extra colours doesn&amp;#39;t change that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to even mention that adding that brown and black strip does nothing to actually help people of colour it merely dilutes the LGBT message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to like the flag but it&amp;#39;s ugly and just screams pandering to me. A bunch of companies wanted to do pride and the  BLM began and then just threw a couple more colours on their profile picture. The original is just better in every way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I know that the flag was not made for BLM. I know that it existed before hand and if I could edit the title I would but I can&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;

For example, in the Amazon show The Boys (FIRST SEASON SPOILERS AHEAD), the main character Hughie &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;kills Translucent with an explosive planted inside his body.&lt;/span&gt; Before the act itself, and earlier within that episode, Hughie is seen looking at a poster contemplatively. The scene implies that staring at the poster made Hughie reflective, but there&amp;#39;s never a good explanation as to what exactly that poster did to change his mind. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_W7hIHnYbc8&quot;&gt;The scene in question.&lt;/a&gt; What was it about that spaghetti-covered baby that changed Hughie&amp;#39;s mind? Was it the phrase, &amp;quot;Keep your hands clean&amp;quot;? Is it a rebellious streak? Did he actually just do it on a whim? We don&amp;#39;t know, but I feel like that&amp;#39;s a great opportunity to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply one example (I haven&amp;#39;t finished the season, so if there&amp;#39;s further explanation in the show, don&amp;#39;t discount my point just on that). An example of what I&amp;#39;m talking about would be from David Lynch&amp;#39;s Dune: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A54yfyi00dI&quot;&gt;Gom Jobbar Scene&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout that film, several characters have an internal monologue, such as Paul&amp;#39;s mother noticing someone else has something on their mind and is holding back information. As problematic as that film can be, I think that&amp;#39;s the best feature. Knowing what someone feels is a huge reason why folks who see film adaptions often feel the book was better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to leave the caveat that this does not really include narration. Narration is a 4th-Wall break, as a character is speaking directly to the audience, and is often done in the past tense. This isn&amp;#39;t to say narration is bad (I actually quite like narrators), but that it is functionally different from a character&amp;#39;s internal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, I&amp;#39;d say most people don&amp;#39;t care. They only care enough to spew out some platitude about &amp;quot;we could have never known!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies and employers and people &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cared, they would do something about the conditions that lead to suicide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t vote against Medicare for All and pretend to give a shit about suicide &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t vote against minimum wage increases and pretend to give a shit about suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t pay your employees starvation wages and pretend to give a shit about suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t hoard housing and raise rent to rates requiring people to spiral into misery and pretend to care about suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t vote against student loan relief and pretend to care about suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t support every condition that leads to suicide and pretend like you give a shit about suicide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies and employers and people who contribute to the conditions of misery that lead people to fantasising about putting a gun to their head cannot pretend to care about those people. If they cared they would actually do something about those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the dictatorship and civil war the country of Somalia has been plagued by violence, anarchy and insurgencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somaliland on the other hand ever since they declared independence in the 1990s has had 5 peaceful and free elections, is one of if not the safest country in Africa and has been ranked by freedom index as a free country. They are stable, and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Region is poor only because they can&amp;#39;t do trade deals on their own. But they are getting investments from companies in rich nations like the UAE and starting to develop. They would deveolpe a lot faster with UN recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for Somalia a failed state to grant its not failed &amp;quot;region&amp;quot; official independence is ridiculous and a slap in the face to Somaliland&amp;#39;s population.&lt;/p&gt;
