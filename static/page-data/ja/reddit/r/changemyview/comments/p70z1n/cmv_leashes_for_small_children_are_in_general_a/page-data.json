And I think most of us are aware of the negative reactions a lot of people give to these leashes, frequently criticizing or shaming parents who use them.</p>\n\n<p>The main argument that I typically hear against them is that it&#39;s treating a child like an animal — but this is a ridiculous argument. It&#39;s supposed that, because we do a specific thing to an animal, that thing must be particular to animals — which is a completely irrational conclusion. We also feed animals, care for animals, cuddle with our pets, dote on them and give them things that make them happy. And we generally keep our animals confined in a controlled space to keep them safe, because they don&#39;t have the ability to manage themselves outside on their own in the modern world. Should we not do these things for children because we also do them for animals? Just because we do it for animals doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s anything dehumanizing about it.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, leashes for small children offer some very humanizing benefits for the child, in addition to being beneficial to the adult.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to, say, holding hands or making the child sit still in one place, it offers the child a fair degree of autonomy and independence while still keeping them nearby, in a space that they are safe, and where the adults can easily intervene if there&#39;s a problem. The child has some freedom to move, to explore, and to be self-directed in what they do.</p>\n\n<p>Also, compared to holding hands, it is likely to be physically more comfortable and better for most children. Imagine having to go around for an hour, or even several hours, with one of your arms sticking straight up in the air. That would get uncomfortable after a while, even if you had something to hang on to to support your arm, right? That&#39;s basically what you&#39;re putting a small child through if you&#39;re making them hold your hand instead of using a leash. They are generally going to be much shorter than you, so holding your hand is going to require them being in that kind of uncomfortable position in most cases. This is fine for short periods of time, but for long outings such as zoo trips or extensive errands this can become uncomfortable, and probably explains why some small children get restless and intolerant of it after a while.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, it does benefit the parent, because the parent doesn&#39;t have to put quite so much effort and attention into keeping track of the child&#39;s movements and activities. The leash, especially if attached to a belt and hands-free, does some of that work for the parent. This means that the parent isn&#39;t as likely to become as tired and exasperated after a long outing with a child, which will not only improve the experience for the parent but also for the child. A less exhausted parent is also better equipped to take any actions that are actually needed to keep the child safe, which results in a safer experience for the child. So even the parts that benefit the parent ultimately benefit the child.</p>\n\n<p>So, leash haters, where am I wrong? What justifies all the leash hate? I&#39;m sure they are not a perfect solution, as everything has a few downsides, and nothing about my claims above state that there might not be situations where a leash is not optimal, or where something might go wrong. And I&#39;m sure some of it depends on the brand, quality, and configuration of the leash as well. And a leash certainly must not be used as an excuse for a parent or guardian to become complacent about the safety of their child. But, overall, if used conscientiously, the benefits seem to outweigh any downsides by orders of magnitude. So, is there any actual rational justification for the seemingly common hatred of child leashes, or am I right that it&#39;s all just irrational personal prejudices?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/p70z1n/cmv_leashes_for_small_children_are_in_general_a/","title":"CMV: Leashes for small children are, in general, a good thing, and the hate they receive is largely unwarranted.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-18T23:35:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-18 23:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2b827536-e596-56fb-a42f-15e8392d34a3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p70z1n/cmv_leashes_for_small_children_are_in_general_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p70z1n/cmv_leashes_for_small_children_are_in_general_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"thelink225","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thelink225","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thelink225","score":95,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 小さな子供のためのリーシュは、一般的には良いことであり、嫌われることはほとんどありません。","the_new_excerpt":"ほとんどの人が見たことがあると思います。\n保護者が持っているか、あるいは保護者の腰のベルトに取り付けられていることが多いです。\n保護者が持っているか、あるいは保護者の腰にベルトをつけている。また、私たちの多くは、このような製品に対して、多くの人が否定的な反応を示すことを知っていると思います。\nそして、このリードに対して多くの人が否定的な反応を示していることも知っていると思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：一般来说，给小孩子系上皮带是件好事，他们受到的憎恨在很大程度上是没有必要的。","the_new_excerpt":"我们中的大多数人都见过他们--蹒跚学步的孩子背着一个背包，上面拴着一根绳子。\n背包由监护人牵着，或者，最好是系在监护人腰上的皮带上。\n监护人腰上的皮带。我想我们中的大多数人都知道\n我认为我们大多数人都知道很多人对这些皮带的负面反应，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：一般來說，給小孩子繫上皮帶是件好事，他們受到的憎恨在很大程度上是沒有必要的。","the_new_excerpt":"我們中的大多數人都見過他們--蹣跚學步的孩子揹着一個揹包，上面拴着一根繩子。\n揹包由監護人牽着，或者，最好是系在監護人腰上的皮帶上。\n監護人腰上的皮帶。我想我們中的大多數人都知道\n我認爲我們大多數人都知道很多人對這些皮帶的負面反應，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4eb971fa-4100-5724-98b5-b719b0b67968","excerpt":"The people - people of all races, colors, creeds, economic statuses, education\nlevels, and morals - who pay their share of taxes do so because that is what\nthey need to do in order to financially secure all of the benefits that being a\ncitizen of the USA provides.\n\nWhen you pay taxes, that means…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/p6f14k/cmv_there_is_literally_nothing_racial_whatsoever/","title":"CMV: There is literally nothing racial whatsoever about requiring valid proof of US Citizenship/ID when collecting social security or voting","date":"August 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 社会保障費の徴収や投票の際に、米国市民権/IDの有効な証明を要求することは、文字通り何の人種的問題もありません。","the_new_excerpt":"人種、肌の色、信条、経済的地位、教育レベル、モラルの違いを問わず、税金を納める人々は\n人種、肌の色、信条、経済状態、教育レベル、モラルにかかわらず、自分の分の税金を払っている人は、それが自分にとって必要なことだからです。\nそれは、アメリカ市民としてのすべての利益を経済的に確保するために必要だからです。\nアメリカの市民であることで得られるすべての利益を経済的に確保するために必要だからです。\n\n税金を払うということは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV: 在领取社会保险或投票时，要求提供有效的美国公民身份/身份证证明，这简直没有任何种族歧视。","the_new_excerpt":"人们--所有种族、肤色、信仰、经济地位、教育水平和道德水平的人们\n的人--各种种族、肤色、信仰、经济地位、教育水平和道德--都缴纳了自己的那份税，因为这是他们需要做的。\n他们需要这样做，以便在经济上确保作为美国公民所能提供的所有福利。\n美国公民提供的所有福利。\n\n当你缴税时，这意味着...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV: 在領取社會保險或投票時，要求提供有效的美國公民身份/身份證證明，這簡直沒有任何種族歧視。","the_new_excerpt":"人們--所有種族、膚色、信仰、經濟地位、教育水平和道德水平的人們\n的人--各種種族、膚色、信仰、經濟地位、教育水平和道德--都繳納了自己的那份稅，因爲這是他們需要做的。\n他們需要這樣做，以便在經濟上確保作爲美國公民所能提供的所有福利。\n美國公民提供的所有福利。\n\n當你繳稅時，這意味着...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2aa04646-cf17-59c6-994e-d5399f2903c1","excerpt":"I wanted to make this post after seeing a woman on twitter basically say that a\nwhite woman shouldn't have made a cookbook about noodles and dumplings because\nshe was not Asian.
