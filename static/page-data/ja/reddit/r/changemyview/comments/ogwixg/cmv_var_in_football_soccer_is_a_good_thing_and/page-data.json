It is football’s implementation of using “live” video playback while a game is in progress to help the referee determine if something had been a foul, if there had been a handball etc. I am not an expert on the precise ways in which it is utilised, but the specifics of it are something like this: the referee is out on the pitch with an earpiece, and can communicate to a room of “VAR referees” who are sitting in front of screens and able to check back on everything that happens from multiple camera angles. If something contentious happens, then the main referee can either request VARs help, or if the referee has missed something VAR may communicate with them and explain they are checking something more closely they think might be amiss. Ultimately the in-game referee may take VAR’s word for something happening a certain way, or decide to run to a screen pitch-side and watch something themselves. The in-game referee has final say on everything and can choose to do with all this what they will.</p>\n\n<p>VAR continues to be very controversial among football fans. There are a number of instances where people get very riled up over it if a wrong decision is deemed to have been made. The most recent example was in the England vs. Denmark game, where England was awarded a critical penalty (which wound up being game-winning) in injury time after it was determined that English striker Sterling had been fouled. Here, the referee immediately awarded the penalty at the moment of the “foul”, which then seemed very dubious when played back on TV (i.e. it seemed at best like a very soft tackle, at worst to be Sterling diving). VAR ran a check before the penalty, and whatever was communicated to the referee didn’t change the course of anything as the penalty still went ahead. The reddit post-game thread was later filled with strong criticism for VAR, citing this as a perfect example of why it is bad / how it fails. Other criticism is more general; for example football pundit Rio Ferdinand is repeatedly critical of it’s role in making “controversial” decisions and his opinion seems to be a common one.</p>\n\n<p>I think that VAR is plainly a benefit to football and criticism against it is extremely illogical. VAR is a tool. It is an opportunity for the referee to gain additional information beyond their limited on-pitch impression of a foul (or whatever) while the game is still in play. If bad decisions are still made, this is in spite of VAR and not because of it. Worrying that VAR might make refereeing decisions worse than they would be without it (as Rio Ferdinand often implies) is similar to saying that a jury of a murder trial should only rely on witness testimony, and not be allowed to see actual CCTV of the death because this would make them somehow more likely to reach the wrong judgement. When fans and pundits criticise VAR for incorrect decisions, they seem to forget that their interpretation of what is “correct” only exists essentially because they and everyone <em>but</em> the referee has the benefit of watching a game <em>with</em> VAR (live TV playback). Giving the referee access to this can only enhance their potential to make a more informed decision.</p>\n\n<p>If a bad call is still made, this is the referee’s fault. If VAR doesn’t seem to have changed the culture of the game as much as it could (e.g. people are still diving all over the place when it could help prove they are faking) then this is an issue with how <em>humans</em> are implementing VAR into the game. It is the assorted match officials who should be the sole subjects of criticism in all these cases.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ogwixg/cmv_var_in_football_soccer_is_a_good_thing_and/","title":"CMV: “VAR” in football (soccer) is a good thing, and most complaints against it are very illogical","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"July 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-09T16:58:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-09 16:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ogwixg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ogwixg/cmv_var_in_football_soccer_is_a_good_thing_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ogwixg/cmv_var_in_football_soccer_is_a_good_thing_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"profheg_II","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/profheg_II","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"profheg_II","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: フットボール（サッカー）における「VAR」は良いことであり、それに対するほとんどの苦情は非常に非論理的である。","the_new_excerpt":"VARとは \"video assisted referee \"のことです。サッカーでは、試合中に\n\"審判がファウルかハンドボールかなどを判断するために、試合中に「ライブ」ビデオを再生することです。\nファウルやハンドボールなどの判定に役立てています。私は専門家ではありませんが\n専門家ではありませんが、このシステムがどのように利用されているかについては、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：足球中的 \"VAR \"是个好东西，大多数对它的抱怨都是非常不合逻辑的","the_new_excerpt":"VAR的意思是 \"视频辅助裁判\"。它是足球的实施，在比赛进行中使用\n在比赛进行中使用 \"现场 \"视频回放，以帮助裁判员确定\n是否有犯规，是否有手球等等。我不是一个\n我不是专家，不知道它的确切使用方法，但...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：足球中的 \"VAR \"是個好東西，大多數對它的抱怨都是非常不合邏輯的","the_new_excerpt":"VAR的意思是 \"視頻輔助裁判\"。它是足球的實施，在比賽進行中使用\n在比賽進行中使用 \"現場 \"視頻回放，以幫助裁判員確定\n是否有犯規，是否有手球等等。我不是一個\n我不是專家，不知道它的確切使用方法，但...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ognwkq","excerpt":"We’ve all seen videos of protesters who’ve been run over because they decided to\nstand in the street and block traffic and someone decided they weren’t going to\nwait and tried to get past them, purposely or accidentally, hitting someone or a\nfew people in the process.\n\nWhile there are definitely…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ognwkq/cmv_protesting_on_the_highway_and_streets_is/","title":"CMV: protesting on the highway and streets is dangerous and shouldn’t be done","date":"July 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：高速道路や路上での抗議活動は危険であり、すべきではない","the_new_excerpt":"デモ参加者が道路に立って交通を妨害したために轢かれてしまったビデオを見たことがあります。\n轢かれてしまったデモ参加者の映像を見たことがあります。\n意図的であれ、偶然であれ、抗議者を追い越そうとし、誰かを轢いてしまったり、抗議者と一緒にいる人を轢いてしまったりしたからです。\nその過程で何人かの人をはねてしまったのです。\n\n確かにそれはありますが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：在高速公路和街道上抗议是危险的，不应该这样做","the_new_excerpt":"我们都看过抗议者的视频，他们被碾压，因为他们决定站在街上，阻断交通，而有人认为他们不愿意。\n因为他们决定站在街上，阻断交通，而有人决定不等他们了，想从他们身边过去。\n故意或意外地试图越过他们，在这个过程中撞到了某人或几个人。\n在这个过程中撞到了某人或几个人。\n\n虽然肯定有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：在高速公路和街道上抗議是危險的，不應該這樣做","the_new_excerpt":"我們都看過抗議者的視頻，他們被碾壓，因爲他們決定站在街上，阻斷交通，而有人認爲他們不願意。\n因爲他們決定站在街上，阻斷交通，而有人決定不等他們了，想從他們身邊過去。\n故意或意外地試圖越過他們，在這個過程中撞到了某人或幾個人。\n在這個過程中撞到了某人或幾個人。\n\n雖然肯定有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ogk3ua","excerpt":"The title says the view for the most part.
