According to Lawyers.com\n[https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from…","body":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Public schools have multiple functions: keeping kids off the street, socialization for kids, imparting lessons of society on them, and obviously education. According to <a href=\"https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from-school.html\">Lawyers.com</a>, suspension is pretty much boiled down to either violent activities (fighting, harassment, possession of weapons, etc), use or possession of drugs, or stealing. </p>\n\n<p>Out of school suspension solves none of the issues while taking away literally all of the benefits/purposes of school. By not allowing a student to attend classes, they obviously aren’t learning, in many cases they aren’t monitored at home because parents have to work, they aren’t socializing with school friends, and they may socialize with worse influences. </p>\n\n<p>Suspension isn’t really meant to rehabilitate its a detrimental punishment akin to solitary confinement which according to one study has lead to prisoners being 3.2x more likely to self harm while incarcerated, so clearly not a great thing. (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement#Self-harm\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement#Self-harm</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Doing this makes zero sense, especially considering high schools all around the world just did a full year of classes online via zoom. Simply have the OSS kids come into school being monitored by a teacher on duty (similar to detention) and have them complete their classes there. Depending on the severity of their actions, additional punishments like classes on things applicable to what they did or community service driven activities to put their time to good use would be far more useful than just sending them home potentially unmonitored to do who knows what. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if the “crime” is so serious they could have school mandated psychologist meetings or something similar to address the problem, or the same could apply to repeat offenders. Lower income families are less likely to be able to afford mental health care, and more likely to act out, so providing them a healthy outlet would be a way to kill 2 birds with one stone in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Even using recorded lectures would be far more beneficial than the system we currently use though I didn’t think of this at first for some reason, even thought it may be a better option.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/paoet6/cmv_out_of_school_suspension_for_high_schoolers/","title":"CMV: out of school suspension for high schoolers makes very little sense today","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-24T16:35:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-24 16:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"paoet6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/paoet6/cmv_out_of_school_suspension_for_high_schoolers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/paoet6/cmv_out_of_school_suspension_for_high_schoolers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Randomminecraftseed","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Randomminecraftseed","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Randomminecraftseed","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 高校生の学校外での停学は、今日ではほとんど意味がありません。","the_new_excerpt":"公立学校には、子供を路上に出さないという複数の機能があります。\n子供たちの社会化、社会の教訓を子供たちに伝えること、そして当然ながら\nそしてもちろん教育です。弁護士ドットコムによると\n[https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：高中生校外停课在今天看来意义不大","the_new_excerpt":"公立学校有多种功能：让孩子们远离街道。\n孩子们的社会化，向他们传授社会的经验教训，显然还有\n教育。根据Lawyers.com的报道\n[https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：高中生校外停課在今天看來意義不大","the_new_excerpt":"公立學校有多種功能：讓孩子們遠離街道。\n孩子們的社會化，向他們傳授社會的經驗教訓，顯然還有\n教育。根據Lawyers.com的報道\n[https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/research/education-law/what-kinds-of-behavior-can-lead-to-suspension-from...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pahsjk","excerpt":"He was a overt racist, introduced segregation in the Federal Government, and Jim\nCrow in to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe did nothing to limit lynching's in the South and appeared to out and out\nsupport the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).\n\nHe and his administration set back racial relations by at least 50 years in…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pahsjk/cmv_woodrow_wilson_was_the_worst_president_in_us/","title":"CMV: Woodrow Wilson was the worst President in U.S history","date":"August 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: ウッドロウ・ウィルソンはアメリカ史上最悪の大統領だった","the_new_excerpt":"彼はあからさまな人種差別主義者で、連邦政府に隔離を導入し、ワシントンD.C.にジム・クロウを導入しました。\nクロウを導入しました。\n\n彼は南部でのリンチを制限することはせず、クー・クラックス・クラン（KKK）を全面的に支持しているように見えました。\n彼は南部でのリンチを制限せず、クー・クラックス・クラン(KKK)を全面的に支持しているように見えました。\n\n彼と彼の政権は、人種関係を少なくとも50年は後退させました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV: 伍德罗-威尔逊是美国历史上最糟糕的总统","the_new_excerpt":"他是一个公开的种族主义者，在联邦政府中引入了种族隔离，并在华盛顿特区引入了吉姆?\n克罗在华盛顿特区。\n\n他没有采取任何措施来限制南方的私刑，而且似乎是在支持三K党。\n支持三K党（KKK）。\n\n他和他的政府在种族关系方面至少倒退了50年。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV: 伍德羅-威爾遜是美國曆史上最糟糕的總統","the_new_excerpt":"他是一個公開的種族主義者，在聯邦政府中引入了種族隔離，並在華盛頓特區引入了吉姆?\n克羅在華盛頓特區。\n\n他沒有采取任何措施來限制南方的私刑，而且似乎是在支持三K黨。\n支持三K黨（KKK）。\n\n他和他的政府在種族關係方面至少倒退了50年。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pao8zt","excerpt":"Entertainment culture abounds in noble protagonists who fight the forces of\nevil, who seek to improve their flaws and who are ultimately seen as heroes who\nsave the world.
