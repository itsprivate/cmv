Throughout the video the contestants play games to either encourage them to leave or risk leaving, these games normally result in the players involved being granted more money on top of the final prize. I haven&#39;t counted it but I&#39;m guessing over the two video series Mr Beast hands out upwards of $800,000 in cash and further prizes such as cars and electronics. My problem is that the magnitude of these prizes makes no sense and I therefore assume it&#39;s bogus.</p>\n\n<p>Giving out huge prizes in entertainment media is not new and I&#39;m going to compare Mr Beast to another show that gives out huge prizes, Who want&#39;s to be a Millionaire. WWTBAM potentially gives out a bigger prize every week but in reality pays out a lot less with most prizes falling a somewhere between $1,000 and $125,000, in over 3000 episodes the top prize has only been awarded 12 times. This means that the production costs (including prize money) is much lower for an episode of WWTBAM than it would be for Mr Beast&#39;s video. For WWTBAM these costs are largely covered by a advertising with multiple paying for significant exposure to a relatively affluent viewing demographic, this makes sense to me, relatively low costs being covered by a wide range of advertisers selling their wares to an audience with money to spend.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Beast is similar but the numbers don&#39;t seem plausible, two videos have had a production cost of, I&#39;m guessing, at least $1,000,000. The sponsor that appears to cover the majority of that cost is Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange that reportedly made $1.6Billion in profit in the first quarter of 2021 so they clearly have cash to burn. However, any responsible company investing $1,000,000 in advertising should be looking at getting at least $1,000,000 of exposure from that investment and this is where I become cynical. In just a few days these videos have racked up a combined 60,000,000 views and I assume that could as much as double over the next few weeks. If they do get up to 120 million views that will be an admittedly staggering amount. However, what do these views represent? A huge number will be from under 18s who are, essentially, worthless to Coinbase as their users must be 18 years old. A further large proportion will be international viewers who, whilst not worthless, will likely be far less valuable than American viewers. What is likely is that a small proportion of unique views will come from the target demographic of American 18-30 year olds. So the useful viewership will be much less than the headline viewer numbers and this is made worse by who that target demographic is US 18-30 years olds, a group who do not have spare money lying around to invest in anything let alone crypto currencies. This makes me extremely cynical that Coinbase sponsoring Mr Beast to the levels reported is a a good use of their money and that makes me think the money is false and just a publicity stunt to drive up interest.</p>\n\n<p>I write this hoping that someone would tell me that the prizes Mr Beast gives away are fake or explain to me why a company investing huge amounts (way beyond traditional media) into a target demographic with little money to spend is a good idea. Cheers.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To be clear I&#39;m expecting to have my view changed about this. To me this is an educational experience where there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t understand how the numbers work and I&#39;m hoping that someone explains it to me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pixtgh/cmv_mr_beasts_prizes_are_fake/","title":"CMV: Mr Beast's prizes are fake","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"September 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-06T19:30:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-06 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pixtgh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pixtgh/cmv_mr_beasts_prizes_are_fake/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pixtgh/cmv_mr_beasts_prizes_are_fake/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Subtleiaint","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Subtleiaint","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Subtleiaint","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: Mr.Beastの賞品は偽物です。","the_new_excerpt":"週末、YouTubeのアルゴリズムは、私にこのビデオを見るよう勧めました。\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYjTTXc-J8\n\nその内容は、100人の人が輪になって、最後に残った人が50万ドルをもらえるというものです。\n50万ドルの賞金が与えられるというものです。ビデオの中で、参加者は\nゲームをしているのですが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：野兽先生的奖状是假的","the_new_excerpt":"周末，YouTube的算法推荐我看这个视频。\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYjTTXc-J8\n\n前提是，一百个人被放在一个圈里，最后离开的人\n将获得50万美元的奖金。在整个视频中，参赛者\n玩游戏，要么...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：野獸先生的獎狀是假的","the_new_excerpt":"週末，YouTube的算法推薦我看這個視頻。\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYjTTXc-J8\n\n前提是，一百個人被放在一個圈裏，最後離開的人\n將獲得50萬美元的獎金。在整個視頻中，參賽者\n玩遊戲，要麼...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pj22jw","excerpt":"How is it that people can say abortion is immoral or murder when it is\nessentially the same concept as pulling the plug on someone who is brain dead?\nWhen you remove a fetus from a body it is not able to survive on its own the\nsame way if you remove someone who is brain dead from life support their…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pj22jw/cmv_abortion_is_no_different_than_pulling_the/","title":"CMV: Abortion is no different than pulling the plug on someone who is brain dead and both are okay","date":"September 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 中絶は、脳死状態の人のプラグを抜くのと変わらず、どちらも問題ありません。","the_new_excerpt":"中絶は、脳死状態の人にプラグを抜くのと本質的に同じ概念であるにもかかわらず、どうして不道徳だとか、殺人だとか言うことができるのでしょうか？\n脳死状態の人のプラグを抜くのと本質的には同じ概念なのに、どうして中絶が不道徳だとか殺人だとか言えるのでしょうか？\n胎児を身体から取り除くと、それだけでは生きていけません。\n同じように、脳死状態にある人を生命維持装置から外すと、その人は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：堕胎与对脑死亡的人拔掉插头没有区别，两者都可以。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么人们可以说堕胎是不道德的或谋杀的呢？\n本质上与拔掉一个脑死亡的人的插头是同一个概念，人们怎么能说堕胎是不道德的或谋杀呢？\n当你把胎儿从身体里取出来时，它就不能独立生存了。\n同样，如果你把一个脑死亡的人从生命支持系统中取出来，他们的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：墮胎與對腦死亡的人拔掉插頭沒有區別，兩者都可以。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼人們可以說墮胎是不道德的或謀殺的呢？\n本質上與拔掉一個腦死亡的人的插頭是同一個概念，人們怎麼能說墮胎是不道德的或謀殺呢？\n當你把胎兒從身體裏取出來時，它就不能獨立生存了。\n同樣，如果你把一個腦死亡的人從生命支持系統中取出來，他們的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pjcj0g","excerpt":"After reading about this disturbing new bill that only took 24 hours to be\npassed through government, I decided it was a good time to do a stock take on\nAustralians' current political system:\n\n'The Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill 2020 gives\nthe Australian Federal…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pjcj0g/cmv_australia_isnt_a_democracy_anymore/","title":"CMV: Australia isn't a democracy anymore","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 07, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: オーストラリアはもう民主主義ではない","the_new_excerpt":"この不穏な新法案を読んだ後、わずか24時間後には\nこの不穏な法案を読んで、オーストラリアの現在の政治システムについて考えてみることにしました。\nオーストラリアの現在の政治システムについて考えてみたいと思います。\n\n「2020年監視法改正法案（Identify and Disrupt）は、オーストラリア連邦...\nオーストラリア連邦...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：澳大利亚不再是一个民主国家了","the_new_excerpt":"在阅读了这一令人不安的新法案后，该法案仅用了24小时就获得通过。\n顺利通过，我决定现在是一个很好的时机，对澳大利亚目前的政治制度进行一次评估。\n澳大利亚人目前的政治制度。\n\n2020年监控立法修正案（识别和干扰）法案》赋予了澳大利亚联邦政府\n澳大利亚联邦...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：澳大利亞不再是一個民主國家了","the_new_excerpt":"在閱讀了這一令人不安的新法案後，該法案僅用了24小時就獲得通過。\n順利通過，我決定現在是一個很好的時機，對澳大利亞目前的政治制度進行一次評估。\n澳大利亞人目前的政治制度。\n\n2020年監控立法修正案（識別和干擾）法案》賦予了澳大利亞聯邦政府\n澳大利亞聯邦...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pixtgh","previousId":"RedditPost-pj22jw","nextId":"RedditPost-pjcj0g","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pixtgh/cmv_mr_beasts_prizes_are_fake/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
