No one is going to argue that someone in the 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s is as sharp as someone in the 50&#39;s; it&#39;s just a foregone conclusion.  Taking out those of that are of this advanced age would stop both sides from wanting &quot;cognitive tests&quot; and whatnot for either side, claiming that neither is fit for office.  (I&#39;m obviously citing Biden and Trump here as examples).</p>\n\n<p>Personal Lifelong Preferences, Beliefs, and Attitudes</p>\n\n<p>-generally, as we become older, most people become &quot;set in their ways&quot;.  There&#39;s a reason this is a saying; it&#39;s because it&#39;s true.  Quite often this means your viewpoints, attitudes, and choices all become psychologically embedded, being unable to break into a newer way of thinking and feeling because you&#39;re just &quot;set in your ways&quot;.  This can be EXTREMELY damaging when it comes to making decisions for people on a large scale because your beliefs may not be the most helpful and because you wield so much power, you could be damaging to progress even when you&#39;re not intending to be.  You have an inability to open your eyes to new ways of thinking, fresher ideas, and ultimately are stifling younger generations from getting what they want and deserve.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Clogging Up the Line&quot;</p>\n\n<p>-everyone is going to die someday.  The longer that people wait to retire and move on, the more it&#39;s backing up every movement forward for us in society.  Politicians don&#39;t seem to have a retirement age; they&#39;re like someone that&#39;s very much into the retirement space, but they also get to dictate policy and make grand decisions.  Younger people aren&#39;t going to want to move into politics on a regular basis until the oldest folks simply go away.  Right now, you have the &quot;Silent&quot; and &quot;Boomer&quot; generations of people just... hanging around FAR longer than their predecessors did.  It&#39;s nice that people are living into their 90&#39;s+, but SERIOUSLY, &quot;Boomers&quot; came into politics in their 40&#39;s back in the 80&#39;s and have just NOT MOVED ON.  They&#39;ve had power so long that Generation X has been nearly completely overlooked and now Millenials are being looked to as the next ones to takes up the mantle.  But... Boomers keep wanting power, keep wanting to stay, NOT retiring.  (I&#39;m looking at you, Mitch McConnel).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I know people are going to argue &quot;well, WISDOM comes with age, and you can&#39;t manifest that; you have to have gone through it&quot;, and to this I say... BULLSHIT.  That&#39;s not true.  There are many, MANY examples of older people simply making stuff up as they go along, lying, getting lucky in the outcome of something, and purporting that &quot;hey, with age comes wisdom; that&#39;s how I knew things would turn out this way&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to be old in order to make good decisions, you just need to be logical and unbiased, which is asking quite a lot from an older individual.</p>\n\n<p>By simple having a MAXIMUM AGE someone can be involved in policy making (70, which is OLD mind you), the more we would have FRESH, YOUNG, BOLDER and, (most importantly), APPLICABLE viewpoints to work with when it comes to the US being representative of the future and NOT the past.  The average age of those in Congress shouldn&#39;t be 65+; it, at MOST, should be 50.  Boomers didn&#39;t have to wait... and wait... and wait for those before them to simply retire so that things could MOVE FORWARD; when they were in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s, they would&#39;ve been dealing with people only 15-20 years older than them AT MOST; not people nearly DOUBLE their age!  This divide is unprecedented in terms of the youngest citizens being forcibly effected by the oldest politicians beliefs, attitudes, and choices, and it&#39;s time to move on.  At this rate, Millenials are going to be in the 50&#39;s before they get any REAL, SUBSTANTIAL say in the way things go in this country, which is NOT what previous generations had to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>Am I an ageist?  Honestly, I don&#39;t think 70 is asking too much from politicians to simple step aside and allow younger people to have their turn making decisions.  That&#39;s 5-7 YEARS past regular retirement age.  If you&#39;re drawing Social Security, you shouldn&#39;t ALSO be allowed to make decisions that could affect younger generations for decades to come (especially when you&#39;ll likely never feel the effects of those decisions long-term).  I feel like younger generations are being forced into being ageist because they&#39;re not able to get anywhere THEY want to go with older generations STILL controlling the narrative.</p>\n\n<p>The line is clogged; unplug the line and retire, old politicians, regardless of your political affiliation.  You&#39;re being unfair to your children, grand children and sometimes your GREAT grandchildren by taking this long to stop pushing your old fashioned beliefs on all of us.  You weren&#39;t subjected to this divide for nearly this long, so why should we?  (I&#39;m speaking as a 37 y/o btw.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ofmbql/cmv_there_should_be_no_politicians_that_are_in/","title":"CMV: there should be no
