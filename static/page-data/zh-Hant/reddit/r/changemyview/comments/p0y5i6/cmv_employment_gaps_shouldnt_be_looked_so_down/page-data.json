It almost could&#39;ve gone so wrong for me. I think not having that time to rejuvenate and fully leave a previous employer because of lack of support and career progression opportunity is tantamount to experiencing more fuck ups and even more misery.</em></p>\n\n<p>Edit: <em>I work in retail which is miserable. But in reality I can’t afford to leave and don’t have enough experience yet to work anywhere else despite having worked in a store for nearly 6 years. I also live in the UK. I apply for a 1000 jobs, and get rejected for a 1000 more. If employers were less picky on who they employ less people would feel the need to take breaks or plan redirections. I am in just a comfortable enough position to leave and hang on for a while, but not to stop working altogether. I also find it hard to have the energy to apply for new jobs when I’m so exhausted and burnt out from the job I’m stuck in. I would quit but I feel pressured not to because of high pressure professionalism standards. I’ve worked straight and never felt the need to take a ‘mental health’ or &#39;lifestyle&#39; break until I considered it recently. I’m only 23 and can usually take what comes. But sometimes it takes a toll, and gets frustrating, when companies offer little support for this kind of situation where you want to leave but feel like you have no choice, but continue to be a slave to a  miserable and unbalanced working life with little reward or benefit, that comes from it except barely being above sea level.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/p0y5i6/cmv_employment_gaps_shouldnt_be_looked_so_down/","title":"CMV: Employment gaps shouldn’t be looked so down upon.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-09T14:32:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-09 14:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p0y5i6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p0y5i6/cmv_employment_gaps_shouldnt_be_looked_so_down/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/p0y5i6/cmv_employment_gaps_shouldnt_be_looked_so_down/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"_alexotoole","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_alexotoole","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_alexotoole","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：雇用のギャップはそれほど軽視されるべきものではありません。","the_new_excerpt":"2年～6年の雇用の空白があった場合、文字通り説明しなければならないことは理解できます。\n働かないでいられる状況にないのであれば、よほどの成功を収めた人や\n働かないでいられる状況にないのであれば、よほどの成功者や\n働かずに済む方法を見つけて、急に必要になった......ということでもない限り、誰もがそうすべきだと思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：就业差距不应该被看得那么轻。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你有一个2年-6年的就业差距，我会理解，这简直是在做解释。\n如果你没有条件不工作，我不认为任何人都应该这样做，除非你变得非常成功或找到工作。\n我认为任何人都应该这样做，除非你变得非常成功或找到了永远不需要工作的方法。\n办法不再需要工作，然后突然需要......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：就業差距不應該被看得那麼輕。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你有一個2年-6年的就業差距，我會理解，這簡直是在做解釋。\n如果你沒有條件不工作，我不認爲任何人都應該這樣做，除非你變得非常成功或找到工作。\n我認爲任何人都應該這樣做，除非你變得非常成功或找到了永遠不需要工作的方法。\n辦法不再需要工作，然後突然需要......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p0ujg4","excerpt":"I’ll start by saying that I understand why she did it, and I support it.\nGymnastics is a very dangerous sport, and being in the wrong mindset can be\nlethal.
