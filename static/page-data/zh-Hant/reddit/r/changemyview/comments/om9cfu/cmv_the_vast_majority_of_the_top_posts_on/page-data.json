What a jerk the other person was being—good for OP, for standing up to them! OF COURSE you&#39;re not the asshole!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The classic most popular AmITheAsshole posts are of the format:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Some friend/family member/person I know did something that is so obviously outrageous, rude, disrespectful, or just plain malicious, and I did something very polite and reasonable like asked them &quot;please don&#39;t touch my personal property&quot; or &quot;leave me alone when I ask you to leave me alone&quot; or &quot;someone spat in my face and disrespected my spouse in public in front of all my friends so I uninvited them to my birthday party. Am I the asshole????&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#39;s obvious these people aren&#39;t being assholes</strong>. Literally no one thinks they&#39;re being assholes except the entitled characters in their stories. Like, if you&#39;re REALLY having to ask that question as a grown adult (which is the case most of the time) and you lack the ability to understand super basic levels of human decency and indecency such that you need random internet strangers to tell you &quot;there there, you&#39;re not the asshole,&quot; there are bigger personal issues for you as a person than whether you were the asshole in one particular interaction (i.e., you don&#39;t know how to function socially).</p>\n\n<p>If a person TRULY doesn&#39;t know how to function socially then such posts are totally fine. </p>\n\n<p>But I think very few of these people are just utterly socially inept in every way—the fact that they have the awareness to identify this as the OTHER party being a <strong>likely</strong> asshole is evidence that they in fact do know that they themselves <strong>weren&#39;t</strong> being the asshole, and are thus not asking for feedback in good faith, but are just trying to get attention.</p>\n\n<p>Hot posts on <a href=\"/r/AmItheAsshole\">r/AmItheAsshole</a> is truly just <a href=\"/r/FreeKarma4U\">r/FreeKarma4U</a> with stories that elicit righteous anger in the readers for upvotes and popularity. Most of the OPs don&#39;t usually engage in high level with the comments on their post, they just sort of sit back and watch the karma collect.</p>\n\n<p>People ought to stop affirming this sort of behavior and should instead comment and upvote more of the posts where the situation in question is genuinely a close call and where both sides have a closer argument, and should downvote posts where the answer is super obvious, because it just dilutes the usefulness of the sub and turns it into a karma farm/circle jerk carnival.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I&#39;m missing? Is there some genuinely good benefit to reddit continually upvoting the most obviously &quot;not the asshole&quot; and continuing to give these people attention when it seems pretty obvious that a lot of them aren&#39;t asking in good faith?
