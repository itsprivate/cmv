Police have so many difficult jobs to do and taking traffic enforcement off the list would allow them to focus and get better at the other responsibilities they have. Traffic stops and issuing of tickets should be performed by unarmed traffic monitors who do not have the power to detain or arrest. If they determine a more serious crime may have happened they can stay in their vehicle and call police for backup.</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of stops are peaceful interactions with otherwise law abiding citizens. When getting pulled over, even a potential violent criminal would not be provoked to escalate the situation to violence if they knew the person stopping them was unarmed and could not detain or arrest them. If someone flees a traffic stop, real cops would be called in for backup.</p>\n\n<p>Having a fully trained and equipped police officer sitting on the side of the highway waiting to ticket people is a big waste or resources. Traffic monitors would require far less training and equipment and therefore be easier on the budget. A police department that currently has 100 patrol officers could instead have 75 officers and 40 less expensive traffic monitors for the same total budget (obviously not exact math but you get the idea). More cops then means the cops could spend more time training and focusing on situations that really require cops.</p>\n\n<p>Serving some period of time on the traffic enforcement corp (a year maybe) could be a pre-requisite for starting the police academy. This could serve as a long trial period to see how well a person does interacting with the public before they are given the higher responsibility of a real officer.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a good idea? Poke holes in it if you can! I know I&#39;m far from the first person to propose it but I&#39;d like to know why this isn&#39;t being implemented in every department nationwide. What are the downsides? CMV!</p>\n\n<p>edit: This post is about policing in the US.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q6186e/cmv_traffic_laws_should_be_enforced_by_an_unarmed/","title":"CMV: Traffic laws should be enforced by an unarmed traffic department","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-11T19:30:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-11 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q6186e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q6186e/cmv_traffic_laws_should_be_enforced_by_an_unarmed/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q6186e/cmv_traffic_laws_should_be_enforced_by_an_unarmed/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"ee_anon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ee_anon","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ee_anon","score":133,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：交通法規は、非武装の交通課が取り締まるべきだ","the_new_excerpt":"警察官に交通法規を守らせることは、資源の非効率的な使用であり\n一般市民と警察官の両方にとって不必要に危険な状況を作り出しています。\nることになります。警察は非常に多くの難しい仕事を抱えています。\n交通違反の取り締まりを外せば、警察官は交通違反の取り締まりに集中でき、より良い仕事ができるようになります。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：交通法应该由非武装的交通部门来执行","the_new_excerpt":"让警察执行交通法规是对资源的低效利用\n并对公众和警察造成不必要的危险情况。\n警员。警察有许多艰巨的工作要做，而把交通执法从清单中删除，就可以让警察们有更多的时间去做。\n执法将使他们能够集中精力，更好地完成......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：交通法應該由非武裝的交通部門來執行","the_new_excerpt":"讓警察執行交通法規是對資源的低效利用\n並對公衆和警察造成不必要的危險情況。\n警員。警察有許多艱鉅的工作要做，而把交通執法從清單中刪除，就可以讓警察們有更多的時間去做。\n執法將使他們能夠集中精力，更好地完成......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5wx18","excerpt":"The Reddit community enjoys downing the military and says troops are “stupid”\nbut I think it actually makes more sense logically to join the military at 18\nthan to go to college and here’s why.\n\nCollege: Pros: You have more choice on where you go if you can get into a school\nthere.
