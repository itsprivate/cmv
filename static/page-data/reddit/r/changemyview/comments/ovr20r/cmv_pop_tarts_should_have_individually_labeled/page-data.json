I’m not angry or upset at Kellogg’s just genuinely of the view that food should be recognizable and identifiable even when out of the box and I’m equally perplexed as to why this particular item isn’t labeled as such. That said I’m not taking this too seriously 😅.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Edit- I’m getting downvoted for responding when my view hasn’t been changed, which is a shame. I appreciate the responses so far. I’ve been polite in my responses but I’m still getting downvoted. Sorry, but my mind has not been changed. I understand the reasons why making this change might be difficult, and I know how I can solve the breakfast roulette problem by labeling myself, but the opinion or view was that the food simply should be labeled like other individually packaged foods are. Thank you for the responses.</em></p>\n\n<p>Original post:\nI enjoy Pop Tarts in general but I’m not into all of the flavors that my family enjoys. For me Pop Tarts are great if they are fruit based but taste like super sweet hot toaster cake if they are one of the chocolate ones. To each their own, if that’s your bliss chase it, just not my thing.</p>\n\n<p>Once you take Pop Tarts out of the box they are indistinguishable from one another. Just a silver sleeve with a mystery inside.</p>\n\n<p>Once you open that mystery sleeve you have approximately 14 seconds to either toast it, eat it cold, or repackage before it starts to go stale.</p>\n\n<p>CMV: It’s ridiculous that Pop Tarts aren’t individually labeled out of the box. In my view it does not make sense for this one product to have non-descriptive packaging when other snacks do have such packaging. I don’t know who made the call to have non-descriptive packaging but I disagree with them. That’s my view. Food should have descriptive packaging both in and out of box. (Or clear packaging I suppose) </p>\n\n<p><strong>More ETA:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people are replying with solutions to the problem or going into details regarding cost for the manufacturers but not explaining why Pop Tarts shouldn’t be labeled. You buy granola bars and dump them out-all labeled. You buy microwave popcorn and dump out the contents, each bag is labeled. I’m not saying that there wouldn’t be a cost to making a change or that I am not able to label them myself. The view is that Pop Tarts <em>should</em> be individually labeled like other snacks are.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don’t want to keep them in the box due to space constraints. (Old house, very narrow cabinets) It is easier to have them in the snack bin. I’ve seen other people do this but they tend to buy just one flavor.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, I could label them myself. Totally valid. But this post isn’t about a workaround, it is about my belief that Kellogg’s should do this and has no (good) reason not to.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don’t understand what makes Pop Tarts different from, for example, granola bars. You open up a box of Nature Valley or Nutri-Grain bars and you get individually wrapped and labeled snacks. Twinkies come in clear packaging. Why is this not the case with Pop Tarts??</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Edited original post to clarify view is about descriptive packaging not about ways to fix this problem for just myself)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ovr20r/cmv_pop_tarts_should_have_individually_labeled/","title":"CMV: Pop Tarts should have individually labeled packages","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-01T16:56:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-01 16:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ovr20r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ovr20r/cmv_pop_tarts_should_have_individually_labeled/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ovr20r/cmv_pop_tarts_should_have_individually_labeled/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"NotYourGa1Friday","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NotYourGa1Friday","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"NotYourGa1Friday","score":77,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: ポップタルトのパッケージには個別ラベルを貼るべきだ","the_new_excerpt":"トーン編集：これは本当に私の見解ですが、軽い気持ちで書いています。Kellogg社に怒っているわけではなく\nただ純粋に、食べ物は認識できるものであるべきだと考えています。\n箱から出しても見分けがつくようにすべきだと思っているので、同じように困惑しています。\nなぜこの商品にはそのような表示がされていないのでしょうか？とはいえ、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：爆米花应该有独立的标签包装","the_new_excerpt":"音调编辑：虽然这确实是我的观点，但它是一个轻松的观点。我不是对凯洛格公司感到愤怒\n我不是对凯洛格公司感到愤怒或不安，只是真正认为食物应该是\n我同样感到疑惑的是，为什么这款产品没有被列入《中国食品报》？\n我同样感到困惑的是，为什么这个特定的项目没有标明是这样的。这就是说，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：爆米花應該有獨立的標籤包裝","the_new_excerpt":"音調編輯：雖然這確實是我的觀點，但它是一個輕鬆的觀點。我不是對凱洛格公司感到憤怒\n我不是對凱洛格公司感到憤怒或不安，只是真正認爲食物應該是\n我同樣感到疑惑的是，爲什麼這款產品沒有被列入《中國食品報》？\n我同樣感到困惑的是，爲什麼這個特定的項目沒有標明是這樣的。這就是說，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ovnnye","excerpt":"Blue collar workers wearing protective gear makes sense.
