Some people argue that it is real and others argue that trans people are mentally ill or just want attention.</p>\n\n<p>After thinking about this for a very long time I realized it doesn&#39;t matter. People should be allowed to express themselves however they choose without ridicule (as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody). If a person born a man, now identifies as a woman and it makes them happy then that is okay. It doesn&#39;t matter whether it it fully real or not.</p>\n\n<p>People are people and we all deserve equal rights. If a woman can get breast implants than a person (of consenting age) Should be allowed to change their genitalia. If it brings them joy and fulfillment it is okay.</p>\n\n<p>PS. I do however think that kids (under age 18) should not be allowed to undergo hormonal therapy or gender realignment surgery but that is a debate for another day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/lkxsry/cmv_it_doesnt_matter_whether_transgenderism_is/","title":"CMV: It doesn't matter whether transgenderism is real or not.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T19:31:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 19:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"648d41e0-bc86-5819-8e15-3170e4ce89bf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lkxsry/cmv_it_doesnt_matter_whether_transgenderism_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lkxsry/cmv_it_doesnt_matter_whether_transgenderism_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Crunchysuds","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crunchysuds","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Crunchysuds","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：变性是真是假并不重要。","the_new_excerpt":"我经常在YouTube上看到人们争论物流问题的辩论。\n变性人主义和变性人群体。有些人认为，这是真正的\n而其他人则认为变性人有精神疾病或者只是想引起注意。\n\n思考了很久，我发现这并不... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：變性是真是假並不重要。","the_new_excerpt":"我經常在YouTube上看到人們爭論物流問題的辯論。\n變性人主義和變性人羣體。有些人認爲，這是真正的\n而其他人則認爲變性人有精神疾病或者只是想引起注意。\n\n思考了很久，我發現這並不... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3db028c4-b1b8-5596-9b17-cf80ed67fa70","excerpt":"I feel like there should be term limits for the Senate and House of Reps.
