However it is can long be said that it is not erasing history rather it is not glorifying the bad elements of the past.</p>\n\n<p>Plenty of people are against taking Statues down but you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find anyone advocating Hitler&#39;s Statues on the basis of historical significance. Because if the argument of historical discussion and &quot;Preservation&quot; is truly a concept that many of the Anti Demolition individuals truly care for; then the same logic can be applied to tyrants such as Hitler, Stalin or any other dictator within history. Because the way I see it, those figures such as Columbus or many of the Slaveowner statues being removed; has as much historical significance as the Hitler Statue but you&#39;ll not be seeing much to anyone want a Hitler Statue up (Note I am not advocating for said Statue, I am making a point here)</p>\n\n<p>As I see with it, this is truly an example of how Historical Preservation doesn&#39;t at all seem to matter to these individuals when brought up with also equally controversial figures. So it is can be said that when the Con&#39;s outweigh the Pro&#39;s in how the person was in life, then a Statue only glorifies their terrible deeds or turns a blind eye to it. Same concept with the Hitler Statue. Nobody denies he pressed anti-smoking laws, or was a devout vegetarian against consuming meat; but his awful terrible deeds in history along with his evilness will far outweigh any sense of humanity and good that he had.</p>\n\n<p>So it is not erasing history to make a point of how we shouldn&#39;t glorify terrible figures of the past whether it be Hitler, Columbus, or any other controversial figure. If you truly want to preserve History then the right place is a Museum or some designated historical sights. A controversial Statue has no place in a public space such as a park. And I find many people see the acts of taking Statues down as being &quot;Sensitive to the past&quot; and with the idea of &quot;You can&#39;t change the past&quot; But the past itself is based on lessons to learn from the Good elements and strive for a better society, not keeping up the bad elements up. When the past is shown with mainly negatives as aforementioned; then it is an issue of setting a lesson to follow on. Nobody sensible advocates slavery, but keeping a Statue up of a mainly former Slave Owner with no positive contributions; sets a terrible lesson to follow by.</p>\n\n<p>Statues were never meant to be an example of history to learn from, they often depict larger-than-life attributes by overexaggerating ones posture and strength; showing more as a lesson to follow by instead of learning from. To learn from, you understand the bad attributes; when you watch a documentary of atrocities in World History; there is not the idea of people should follow in the same ideas but rather teach about the harsh realities and show how circumstances came into play with it. Lessons to follow by, are examples that show said figure as mainly heroic qualities that downplay the severity of terrible actions; an example of this is the Lost Cause movement for the Confederates which try to paint them as either being &quot;Victims of Northern Aggression&quot; or try to paint the Civil War as not having any relevancy to Slavery.</p>\n\n<p>Ether way; Statues are meant to glorify the good traits, so anyone arguing about the principle of &quot;erasing history&quot; in my opinion; doesn&#39;t seem to understand the purpose of a Statue and how preserving history truly works. But hey I may be wrong, I would love to discuss it in the comments and am open to new interpretations.  </p>\n\n<p>TLDR Its not erasing history, but rather it doesn&#39;t glorify the past since people who have done bad things mainly; don&#39;t deserve a Statue as a Statues purpose isn&#39;t to educate but rather set an example for others to follow by since a Statue is a symbol of mainly an accomplishment. And that an alternative is to have the history of bad people be within museums or a historical sight.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pks7hd/cmv_its_not_erasing_history_to_remove_statues/","title":"CMV: Its not erasing History to remove Statues","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"September 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-09T14:31:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-09 14:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pks7hd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pks7hd/cmv_its_not_erasing_history_to_remove_statues/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pks7hd/cmv_its_not_erasing_history_to_remove_statues/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"King_Of_Boxes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/King_Of_Boxes","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"King_Of_Boxes","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: 像を撤去することは歴史を消すことではありません。","the_new_excerpt":"像の撤去は歴史を消してしまうとよく言われますが、それはロバート・E・リーであれ何であれ、問題となっている人物についての「議論がなくなる」からです。\nロバート・E・リーであれ、クリストファー・コロンブスであれ、問題となっている人物についての「議論」がなくなるからです。\nロバート・E・リーであれ、クリストファー・コロンブスであれ、その他の物議を醸す人物であれ、その像が撤去されると\n議論がなくなる」からです。しかし、歴史を消しているわけではない、とも言われています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：移除雕像并非抹杀历史","the_new_excerpt":"因此，人们经常说，移除雕像会抹去历史，因为 \"它消除了\n讨论 \"有关的人物，无论是罗伯特-李还是克里斯托弗-哥伦布或其他有争议的人物。\n克里斯托弗-哥伦布或任何其他有争议的人物的雕像都被移除。\n雕像被移走。然而，可以说，这并不是在抹杀历史......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：移除雕像並非抹殺歷史","the_new_excerpt":"因此，人們經常說，移除雕像會抹去歷史，因爲 \"它消除了\n討論 \"有關的人物，無論是羅伯特-李還是克里斯托弗-哥倫布或其他有爭議的人物。\n克里斯托弗-哥倫布或任何其他有爭議的人物的雕像都被移除。\n雕像被移走。然而，可以說，這並不是在抹殺歷史......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pkejam","excerpt":"With the WHO announcing Covid is likely here to stay, I feel like the caveat\nthat “we had an opportunity early on to stop this”, is kind of bullshit.\n\nSure - in a perfect world where humans didn’t need to eat, get medicine, go to\nthe hospital, interact with their kids, call the police, check on…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/pkejam/cmv_i_dont_buy_the_whole_we_could_have_stopped/","title":"CMV: I don’t buy the whole “we could have stopped Covid” theory","date":"September 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：私は「コヴィッドを止められた」という説は信じていません。","the_new_excerpt":"WHOがコヴィドの存続を発表したことで、「早い段階でこれを阻止する機会があった」という注意書きが、なんだか腑に落ちません。\nこれを止める機会が早くからあった」という注意書きは、なんだかでたらめのような気がします。\n\n確かに、人間が食べる必要も、薬をもらう必要も、病院に行く必要も、子供と触れ合う必要も、電話をかける必要もない完璧な世界では、このようなことはありません。\n食べる必要も、薬をもらう必要も、病院に行く必要も、子供と触れ合う必要も、警察を呼ぶ必要も、家を確認する必要もない完璧な世界では、確かに","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：我不相信 \"我们本来可以阻止科维德 \"的理论。","the_new_excerpt":"随着世卫组织宣布Covid很可能会在这里继续存在，我感觉到了这样的告诫\n\"我们在早期就有机会阻止它\"，这是一种废话。\n\n当然--在一个完美的世界里，人类不需要吃东西、拿药、去医院、与孩子交流、打电话给家人或朋友。\n医院，与他们的孩子互动，打电话给警察，检查......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：我不相信 \"我們本來可以阻止科維德 \"的理論。","the_new_excerpt":"隨着世衛組織宣佈Covid很可能會在這裏繼續存在，我感覺到了這樣的告誡\n\"我們在早期就有機會阻止它\"，這是一種廢話。\n\n當然--在一個完美的世界裏，人類不需要喫東西、拿藥、去醫院、與孩子交流、打電話給家人或朋友。\n醫院，與他們的孩子互動，打電話給警察，檢查......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pkx184","excerpt":"I think it is safe to say that by this point in the pandemic, everyone in the\nUnited States possesses a mask.
