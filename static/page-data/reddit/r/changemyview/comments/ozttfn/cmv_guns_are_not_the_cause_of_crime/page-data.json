I do not think they make it more dangerous. </p>\n\n<p>I think guns on top of other social and health issues becomes a bigger problem. Guns do not make a problem on their own though. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at the most dangerous US cities: Detroit, St. Louis, Memphis, Baltimore, Springfield, Little Rock, Cleveland, Stockton, Albuquerque &amp; Milwaukee (according to a 2020 CBS news article).</p>\n\n<p>So you have 4 cities that are in red states that have some of the loosest gun control in the US. You have 2 in a blue state with restrictive gun laws. You then have 4 in purple states that also have looser gun laws.</p>\n\n<p>Safest cities: Columbia, South Burlington, Plano, Nashua, Lewiston, Burlington, Salem, Virginia Beach, Raleigh &amp; Gilbert (according to USNews). </p>\n\n<p>Here, you mostly have the safest cities in states with the least restrictive gun laws. You have 2 cities in states that have some of the most restrictive laws.</p>\n\n<p>Cities with the lowest homicide rates: Irvine CA, Naperville IL, McAllen TX, Allen TX, Glendale CA, Gilbert AZ, League City TX, Frisco TX, Pearland TX, Murrietta CA (based on numbers from Global Peace Index).</p>\n\n<p>Pretty interesting list right? Stark opposite states yet similar results for those cities. 3 cities are in gun restrictive CA and 1 in restrictive IL. All the rest (but one) are in unrestrictive Texas and the other in unrestrictive AZ.</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted, that those cities have <strong>lower homicide rates than many major European cities!</strong></p>\n\n<p>So sure, CA gun laws are restrictive for the US, but a lot more is available versus other countries. Yet, with the proper group of people (and gun) people do not have high numbers of rapes, assaults and murders.</p>\n\n<p>Texas… you can pretty much get anything legally in Texas. SBRs, grenade launchers, <em>actual</em> machine guns, suppressors and ARs. Yet some places went a whole year without a murder? Lower rates of rapes and assaults? All that and getting a dangerous “assault weapon” is easy with a “high capacity” magazine as well. </p>\n\n<p>Guns are not an issue. The issues are poverty, education and mental health.</p>\n\n<p>It should be no surprise that the median income in the some the safest cities is ~$75,000. In Columbia think it was ~$105,000.</p>\n\n<p>More often than not, people show they can be responsible gun owners. I don’t think people’s personal freedoms and rights should be diminished because minuscule amount of people do bad things with guns.</p>\n\n<p>There is clear evidence that decent human beings can have what people are so scared of and so absolutely nothing nefarious with them. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of tying to get rid of some guns just because the way they look or because of the fringe occurrences that they are used… focus on the real issues and not try to restrict people’s rights. </p>\n\n<p>My view maybe flawed, so explain it to me.</p>\n\n<p>Some people have access to “more dangerous” firearms but still have little to no crime in their area.</p>\n\n<p>Other people have access to the same but the crime is horrible.</p>\n\n<p>Does that not point to guns not being the underlying problem?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/ozttfn/cmv_guns_are_not_the_cause_of_crime/","title":"CMV: Guns are not the cause of crime.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"August 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-07T16:35:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-07 16:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ozttfn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ozttfn/cmv_guns_are_not_the_cause_of_crime/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ozttfn/cmv_guns_are_not_the_cause_of_crime/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Babou_FoxEarAHole","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Babou_FoxEarAHole","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Babou_FoxEarAHole","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：犯罪の原因は銃ではありません。","the_new_excerpt":"だから私は、銃があるからといって場所が悪くなることはないと思っています。私は、銃が\nより危険な場所にしてしまうとは思いません。\n\n他の社会問題や健康問題の上に銃があると、より大きな問題になると思います。\nしかし、銃はそれだけでは問題になりません。\n\nアメリカで最も危険な都市を見てみましょう。デトロイト、セントルイス、...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：枪支不是犯罪的原因。","the_new_excerpt":"因此，我相信枪支本身并不会使地方变得更糟。我不认为\n它们使地方更加危险。\n\n我认为枪支在其他社会和健康问题之上会成为一个更大的问题。\n但枪支本身并不构成问题。\n\n让我们看看美国最危险的城市。底特律、圣路易斯、...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：槍支不是犯罪的原因。","the_new_excerpt":"因此，我相信槍支本身並不會使地方變得更糟。我不認爲\n它們使地方更加危險。\n\n我認爲槍支在其他社會和健康問題之上會成爲一個更大的問題。\n但槍支本身並不構成問題。\n\n讓我們看看美國最危險的城市。底特律、聖路易斯、...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ozjrix","excerpt":"If it could be shown that the video or audio of an officer’s body cam was turned\noff manually especially during an active scene with injuries/death, the first\nviolation should be a strict no pay suspension for many months.
