There are some old laws on the books that say crazy things like women can&#39;t swear in public - these laws would expire.</p>\n\n<p>You might think &quot;But wouldn&#39;t it get cumbersome every 10 years to have to re-vote all the crimes into being crimes?&quot; The answer is YES, and that is a very good thing. Imagine if politicians had to affirmatively vote &quot;Yes, weed should remain illegal,&quot; &quot;Yes, victimless crime XYZ should remain illegal,&quot; every decade.</p>\n\n<p>The public would hound politicians to no end if they voted Aye on many of these laws. And thousands upon thousands of worthless and ridiculous laws would expire off the books, to the benefit of all citizens. They say the average American unknowingly commits 1 to 2 felonies per day, and you only are only relying on the grace of prosecutors not to come after you.
