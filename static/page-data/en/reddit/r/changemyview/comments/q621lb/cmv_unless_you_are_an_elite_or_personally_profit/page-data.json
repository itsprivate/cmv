If convicted on all counts, he faces 175 years in prison. </p>\n\n<p>These charges all stem from his participation in the acquisition and publication of the Iraq War Logs and other documents from whistleblower Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 2011. That is, none of his alleged crimes have anything to do with the DNC or Podesta email leaks, nor with the 2016 US Presidential election or Russian collusion. </p>\n\n<p>My CMV is about groups of US voters themselves, not politicians, parties, or political factions, each of which may have good reasons (from their perspective) to support Assange&#39;s prosecution, or at least to not stand in the way. I&#39;m going to lay out some of the major US voting blocs and explain why I think they should oppose the prosecution. None of this is to say they should like Assange or think he&#39;s a good person, only that he should not be prosecuted. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Marxists/socialists/leftists:</strong> This seems the most obvious: the US government, particularly the foreign policy and national security state, is the largest pro-capitalist and anti-communist force on earth. Leftists are among the most persecuted by FBI and CIA; the ability to publish documents that embarrass them must be defended. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Progressives/Liberals:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/julian-assange-unlikely-to-face-us-charges-over-publishing-classified-documents/2013/11/25/dd27decc-55f1-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html?utm_term=.1744d3623b8f\">WaPo describes in 2013</a> the Obama DoJ&#39;s decision not to prosecute Assange:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Justice officials said they looked hard at Assange but realized that they have what they described as a “New York Times problem.” If the Justice Department indicted Assange, it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The charges that Trump&#39;s DoJ eventually brought against Assange are over the same alleged offenses that Obama&#39;s declined to prosecute. If you are a liberal or progressive that holds Assange partially responsible for Trump&#39;s victory in 2016, that&#39;s a fair position to hold, but it does not follow that he should be prosecuted for unrelated offenses, particularly when such prosecution is a threat to press freedom and human rights. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Religious Right</strong>: The religious right is generally supportive of the troops and of the US military, seeing it as a force for good in the world. They should not want the military to be committing war crimes in their name, and if it is, those responsible should be held responsible. Assange is being persecuted for calling out the evil deeds of men and women in positions of authority. Christians should praise his courage. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Trump Republicans:</strong> Trump praised WikiLeaks and Assange when they were publishing emails that made his opponents look bad. To the extent that Trump was railroaded by the &quot;Deep State,&quot; the right to publish documents exposing their alleged corruption is something Trump supporters should want. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Right libertarians</strong>: The US government is the biggest violator of individual liberty; the ability to publish documents that embarrass them must be defended. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>What won&#39;t CMV:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The sexual assault allegations against Assange: they may be true, but are irrelevant to the charges being brought against him</li>\n<li>Criticisms of his character: again, possibly true, but do not justify prosecution on charges that threaten press freedom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What would CMV:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A significant and identifiable group of US voters who have a legitimate or defensible reason to support the prosecution of Assange under the current charges.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/q621lb/cmv_unless_you_are_an_elite_or_personally_profit/","title":"CMV: Unless you are an elite or personally profit from the national security state, every political voting bloc in the US should be opposed to the DoJ prosecution of Julian Assange under the Espionage Act.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-12T03:34:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-12 03:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q621lb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q621lb/cmv_unless_you_are_an_elite_or_personally_profit/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q621lb/cmv_unless_you_are_an_elite_or_personally_profit/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"IcedAndCorrected","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IcedAndCorrected","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"IcedAndCorrected","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: あなたがエリートであったり、国家安全保障国家から個人的に利益を得ているのでなければ、米国のすべての政治的投票圏は、ジュリアン・アサンジをスパイ活動法に基づいて司法省が起訴することに反対すべきです。","the_new_excerpt":"ジュリアン・アサンジは現在、英国のベルマーシュ刑務所に収監されています。\n米国政府は、アサンジの身柄を引き渡さないとした下級裁判所の判決を不服として控訴しており、その決定を待っています。\n米国政府は、アサンジを米国に送還しないとした下級審判決に対する控訴審の判決を待っています・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：除非你是一个精英或个人从国家安全状态中获利，否则美国的每个政治投票集团都应该反对司法部根据间谍法起诉朱利安-阿桑奇。","the_new_excerpt":"朱利安-阿桑奇目前正坐在英国的贝尔马什监狱里，等待美国政府对下级法院不予起诉的决定作出裁决。\n美国政府对下级法院不将其引渡到美国的决定提出的上诉的决定。\n美国政府对下级法院不把他引渡到美国的决定提出上诉，等待裁决。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：除非你是一個精英或個人從國家安全狀態中獲利，否則美國的每個政治投票集團都應該反對司法部根據間諜法起訴朱利安-阿桑奇。","the_new_excerpt":"朱利安-阿桑奇目前正坐在英國的貝爾馬什監獄裏，等待美國政府對下級法院不予起訴的決定作出裁決。\n美國政府對下級法院不將其引渡到美國的決定提出的上訴的決定。\n美國政府對下級法院不把他引渡到美國的決定提出上訴，等待裁決。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5y5zu","excerpt":"First of all and most obviously they are committing a genocide of a minority\npopulation, sure it's not at shove as many people into the gas chamber level of\ngenocide yet but neither was pre-war nazi Germany.
