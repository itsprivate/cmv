Interestingly it seems like this idea has become popular even among the center-left (which I feel are fairly dominate on reddit) which I find odd. I often seem comments saying something along the lines of &quot;Oh I&#39;m a big liberal/democrat and I support LGBTQ+ rights and yada yada, but damn I really hate what cancel culture has done to our society.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I personally think that cancel culture isn&#39;t even really much of a real thing, let alone a serious issue facing our society. I believe it is a dogwhistle used by the right to indirectly attack leftist activists that has successfully poisoned leftist discourse. I mean, seriously, let&#39;s take a look at some of the people who were &quot;cancelled&quot; recently.</p>\n\n<p>-- R Kelly: Abused vulnerable women on mass, exhibited predatory behavior, basically ran a deranged abusive sex cult for years. Dose this person not deserve to be &quot;cancelled?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>--Chris Pratt. Supposedly attended anti-LGBTQ church meetings. Is still immensely popular and is still getting work in a major motion picture. Was this person really &quot;cancelled?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>-- Dave Chappelle. Mocked the Me-Too movement, repeatedly made jokes punching down at the trans and gay communities. Again, Dave still has a major platform, tons of dedicate followers, and is a multi-millionaire. He acts as if his &quot;free speech&quot; has somehow been restricted yet he was and still is now free to say whatever he wants and has consistently been given a platform to do so. How has he in any way been &quot;cancelled?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>--Billy Cosby. A literal rapist. Dose this person deserve to have a platform?</p>\n\n<p>People often use the cancel culture phrase in relation to comedy, as according to them the problem somehow disproportionally affects comedians. I don&#39;t see why people seem to think that comedians are entitled to a platform? People act as if comedy is somehow immune to criticism of its content. That comedy must be &quot;protected speech&quot; in some capacity. I really don&#39;t agree with this, I think comedians should be as open to anyone else is for criticism of the social impact of their content. At the end of the day a comedian&#39;s goal is to make people laugh, and if someone who is trans or gay or otherwise disadvantaged finds a piece of comedy distasteful they&#39;re perfectly justified in saying &quot;I don&#39;t find this funny and I don&#39;t think this person deserves a platform like this.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I&#39;m just rambling at this point but I think some people have this odd view in their heads of &quot;free speech.&quot; They think that free speech means that every single person is entitled to a platform that they can use to broadcast their message to others. That every single person has an inalienable human right to use twitter, reddit, youtube, or stand up comedy to spout their views out to the world. In my opinion that&#39;s simply not the case, free speech only entitles you to protection from the federal government in relation to your speech, it doesn&#39;t mean that private institutions such as Netflix or Twitter or whoever has an obligation to use their platform to publish whatever you say.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qgyjwf/cmv_cancel_culture_is_a_conservative_dogwhistle/","title":"CMV: \"Cancel culture\" is a conservative dogwhistle used to make leftists feel that fighting for social justice is somehow a bad thing.","tags":["changemyview","reddit"],"date":"October 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-27T18:31:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-27 18:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qgyjwf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qgyjwf/cmv_cancel_culture_is_a_conservative_dogwhistle/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qgyjwf/cmv_cancel_culture_is_a_conservative_dogwhistle/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"changemyview","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview","author":"Zippy0723","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zippy0723","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Zippy0723","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV: \"Cancel culture \"は、社会正義のために戦うことが何か悪いことのように左派の人々に感じさせるために使われる保守的な犬笛です。","the_new_excerpt":"最近、インターネット上の言説でよく見かける言葉が、この考え方です。\n「ここ数週間は、Dave Chappelleの新しいコメディー番組をめぐる論争のせいで\nDave Chappelleの新しいコメディ・スペシャルをめぐる論争のためです。興味深いことに、この考え方は\n興味深いことに、この考えは中道左派（私は...と感じています）の間でも人気があるようです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV：\"取消文化 \"是一个保守派的狗皮膏药，用来让左派觉得为社会正义而战在某种程度上是一件坏事。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近在互联网讨论中经常看到一个短语，就是这种想法\n\"取消文化\"，在过去的几周里更是如此，因为围绕着Dave Chappelle的新喜剧特辑的争论\n围绕Dave Chappelle的新喜剧特辑的争议。有趣的是，似乎\n这种想法甚至在中左派中也变得流行起来（我觉得他们是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV：\"取消文化 \"是一個保守派的狗皮膏藥，用來讓左派覺得爲社會正義而戰在某種程度上是一件壞事。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近在互聯網討論中經常看到一個短語，就是這種想法\n\"取消文化\"，在過去的幾周裏更是如此，因爲圍繞着Dave Chappelle的新喜劇特輯的爭論\n圍繞Dave Chappelle的新喜劇特輯的爭議。有趣的是，似乎\n這種想法甚至在中左派中也變得流行起來（我覺得他們是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qgq4k1","excerpt":"Everybody likes to delude themselves that 4chan is some sort of aberration, a\ndisgusting pimple on the face of the internet, and that the \"real\" internet is a\nwelcoming and wholesome place.\n\nBut 4chan is the ONLY place on the internet where all legally protected speech\nis permissible, and only…","slug":"/reddit/r/changemyview/comments/qgq4k1/cmv_every_social_media_site_would_be_like_4chan/","title":"CMV: Every social media site would be like 4chan if they all abandoned moderation.","date":"October 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CMV：すべてのソーシャルメディアサイトがモデレーションを放棄したら、4chanのようになってしまいます。","the_new_excerpt":"誰もが4chanがある種の異常であると錯覚したがる。\nインターネットの顔についた嫌なニキビのようなもので、「本当の」インターネットは歓迎すべき健全な場所だと\n歓迎された健全な場所であると錯覚したいのです。\n\nしかし、4chanはインターネット上で唯一、法的に保護されたすべての言論が許される場所です。\n許されている唯一の場所なのです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CMV: 如果每个社交媒体网站都放弃审核，那么它们就会像4chan一样。","the_new_excerpt":"每个人都喜欢自欺欺人地认为4chan是某种反常现象，是互联网上的一个恶心的疙瘩。\n而 \"真正的 \"互联网是一个热情洋溢和健康的地方，它是互联网上的一个恶心的疙瘩。\n而 \"真正的 \"互联网是一个热情洋溢和健康的地方。\n\n但4chan是互联网上唯一的地方，所有受法律保护的言论\n是被允许的，而且只有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CMV: 如果每個社交媒體網站都放棄審覈，那麼它們就會像4chan一樣。","the_new_excerpt":"每個人都喜歡自欺欺人地認爲4chan是某種反常現象，是互聯網上的一個噁心的疙瘩。\n而 \"真正的 \"互聯網是一個熱情洋溢和健康的地方，它是互聯網上的一個噁心的疙瘩。\n而 \"真正的 \"互聯網是一個熱情洋溢和健康的地方。\n\n但4chan是互聯網上唯一的地方，所有受法律保護的言論\n是被允許的，而且只有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qgjxeu","excerpt":"I have no issue with inclusivity and couldn’t care less why you identify as/who\nyou’re attracted to, that’s totally your business.
